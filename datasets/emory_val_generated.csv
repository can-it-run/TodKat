I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?	My God! What happened to you?	Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.	That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!	Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!	Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.	Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.	It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.	Well.... it is amouz-ing...	Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.	Ten dollars an hour for what?	Waitressing?	Uh-oh.	Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...	But, but?	But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.	Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.	You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.

I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.	You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.	Done.	5	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	4	0

It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.	Whoa! And the... huh-huh?	Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...	You cuddled.	Yeah, which was nice.

Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!	Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!	Great, now he's waving back.	Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!	What kinda stuff?	Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.	You cook naked?	Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.	What are you looking at me for?
