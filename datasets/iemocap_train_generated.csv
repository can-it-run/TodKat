What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	He was out here when it broke.	About four this morning. I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.	I don't know. But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.	No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.	Yes, yes he is. I don't know the meaning in it. But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.	I don't want to argue with him. But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him? Do we contradict him? Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore? That we haven't had any hope for a long time?	For Gods sake, three years! Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane!	The trouble is the God damn newspapers, I mean, ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere. So the next one is gonna be Larry. So you--	All right. All right, just listen.	You know it's not just my business.	What do you want me to do? I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.	So it's all right then? I should just go ahead with it?	Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.	I ignore what I got to ignore. I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	She's not Larry's girl.	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	what to hell with that!	Have you asked Annie yet?	Well, how do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels like your father does.	I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right? Mom, don't avoid me.	The trouble is you don't see enough women. You never did.	So what, I'm not fast with women?	Because it is.	Well, that's a good reason. But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war. It's been five years.	[garbage] I don't know. It's just,	she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her. When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?	No I don't want a- Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris. If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.	Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know? I don't.	All right then, mom.	I've given it three years of thought. I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.	But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.	I'll get out. I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.	Are you crazy?	The business? The business doesn't inspire me.	Must you be inspired?	Yeah, I'd like one hour a day. If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful. I'd like a family. I'd like some kids.	You don't want to think like that.	All right. But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris? All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.	I know that, mom. Just you help me stay here.	Well, I am thinking like that.	I don't understand you, do I?	No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	3	3	3	3	3	3	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	3	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	4	1	4
Did you get the letter?	Yes. There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know.	Yeah. That is so awesome. M: Did you-	Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER]	Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh. That's what loans are for? Right? Exactly.	I'm really excited. Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah. Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that.	Oh. Good, good. That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here? Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?	Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know.	I don't know. I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather.	This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay. You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.	I know. We should throw a party.	A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.	I am just- Yeah. I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing. I'm living here. I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo. F:Yay.	Yeah. Big time.	Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major? What are you doing?	Yeah. I'm not sure.	Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.? Or can you...? Nice	Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER]	That's good. Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?	Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.	So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.? That's my mother.	You have to get married. Well you are married to Chuck. You're Mrs. Nash. Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning. F:[GARBAGE]	I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.	Yay...School's fun.	Of course, right. That's where the real money is, being a student.	That's how you get the big bucks. Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.	I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time. The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm. Yeah.	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	0	2	5
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	It's all right. It's a good thing. It's lovely here. The air is sweet.	So, you're not sorry I came?	Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.	Well-	I figured they would, your mother at least.	Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?	You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair? I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.	Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.	I almost got married two years ago.	You felt something that far back?	Everyday since.	Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say? I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.	oh, God I kissed Annie. I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?	Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now. I'm going to make you so happy.	Not like that you're not.	Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris. What's the matter?	Lets go for a ride. I I- I want to be alone with you.	No, nothing like that.	Even in your letters there was something ashamed.	Yeah, I suppose I have been. But it's going for me.	You have to tell me.	I don't I don't know where to start.	It wouldn't work like this.	It's so mixed up with so many other things.	Yeah, sure.	I lost them.	How many?	Just about all.	It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.	I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They killed themselves for each other.	I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.	It was and then I went home. And it was incredible. It didn't have any meaning there.	I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.	It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys. And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,	you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that. Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.	And I guess that included you.	Do you still feel like that?	I want you now, Annie.	Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris. Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.	Oh, Annie,	[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?	Annie I am going to make you a fortune. M: Oh [garbage]	0	2	5	0	0	0	0	5	2	3	2	2	5	5	5	5	3	3	3	3	3	3	0	3	3	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	1	1	3	3	3	3	5	2	2
He saw it.	He was out there when it happened.	Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.	I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.	Did you talk to him?	No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.	He cried hard, huh?	I could hear it right through the floor.	I guess he is.	Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?	I don't know.	But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.	Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	What do you mean, dishonest?	What, you're going to argue with him?	No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.	You can't tell him that.	We got to tell him that.	We can't. It just won't work.	You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane.	They do come back.	All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.	It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.	All right. All right. Just come on, sit down.	What?	You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?	Why?	You know.	I want to ask her to marry me.	Well, that's only your business, Chris.	Come on, you know that's not only my business.	Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.	So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.	Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying.	See, then it's not just my business. God, you have	-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.	Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.	And she-she's Larry's girl.	Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.	'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?	What do you want from me?	Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.	You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.	To hell with that.	There's nothing wrong with it.	I didn't ask Annie yet.	You didn't ask her yet?	I wanted to get this settled first.	Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.	I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?	Mom, don't avoid me.	You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.	So what? I'm not fast with women.	I don't understand why it has to be her.	Because it is.	That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.	I just-	I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.	It just is. I-	I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?	No, I don't want a diagram.	He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?	Okay. All right, then.	Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.	No, I've given it three years of thought.	But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.	I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.	You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?	The business. The business doesn't inspire me.	Oh, you have to be inspired.	Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.	Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.	Now, where do I find it?	Tell me something.	You'd leave that business.	Yes. On this I would.	You can't do that.	Then help me stay here.	All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.	Okay. Just-	We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.	Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?	I'm going to.	I am thinking like that.	I don't know you, do I?	No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	Yeah. I can see that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	4	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	4	4	1	1	1	1	1	3	0	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	4	4	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...	Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.	That's the wind.	Well, so? What do you think?	I think it's ridiculous.	It's a PR.	It's not just me, okay? Look at like all the people.	They're all told the same thing.	Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more.	Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action.	Their life will start then.	I'm sorry it still just fish to me.	Can I ask you a question? Are you on your period?	Why do you ask me that? God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.	I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	Is not supposed to like anything. We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.	Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.	Why not?	Because they never do. Do they, have they ever?	We missed them twice.	Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.	Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me.	No we won't. It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.	I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.	Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards	You don't understand anything I'm saying.	and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.	Of course not.	Okay. I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.	you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.	Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the the Grunions are running tonight, and I said okay great, let's go.	So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--	Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.	And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.	Wait a minute, I've got it.	It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said let's get some champagne and I said no time to wasting or something like that. That's what it is, right?	I'd rather not remember some things. I'd rather not hope for some things.	Oh right sure, of course.	No.	You want me to go get some champagne?	No.	Do you want to take off our shoes?	What? Huh?	You want to get married again?	What? What? You want to divorce?	No.	A vacation?	No.	A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what? What? What the hell do you want?	I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.	Well, welcome to the human race.	You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to. You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line. We would come to this beach and argue over fish? No.	No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--	No. You know what you get? You know what you get? You get this.	This what? What is this? This isn't even anything.	Yeah, it is.	Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.	Right.	This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.	I know me neither.	This is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?	I'm doing the best I can.	I know that Augie, I really do.	I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.	Maybe if you were with somebody else too?	I didn't say that.	No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.	Yeah?	You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.	Look what we got here.	It's not champagne.	I guess we don't need glasses.	Are you cold, huh? Do you want to go home?	I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think this might be the spot after all.	Augie, I'm sorry.	Shh...	If we are really quiet, the fish might come.	Or not.	Or not.	5	5	0	5	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	4	4	1	1	1	4	0	4	1	4	4	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	3	0	3	0	3	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	4	4	1	4	3	3	4	0	4	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	0	2	0	2	3	2	2	0	0
Hey.	Esmeralda, guess what?	What?	[LAUGHTER] Guess who just got hitched?	This guy. Yeah. Can you believe it? She said yes too. Yeah. She said yes.	Okay we were at Chuck E. Cheese.	Chuck E. Cheese? Ah, man that is so lame.	Are you serious [GARBAGE] man?	Oh like that one movie. What's that one movie I just saw? No. Where she like swallows the...	oh, I don't remember. Everybody Says I Love You with Drew Barrymore...no you haven't seen it? Okay.	[LAUGHTER] So nasty. No you... dirty me?	Ah...Anyways, so she took the ring and she goes, is this real? So I was like, of course--	Sara and I--	She actually asked if it was real? I would've probably asked the same thing considering you were in Chuck E. Cheese.	Come on. It was her birthday.	She wanted...she always wants something spontaneous.	Yeah. That's, you know, okay.	I couldn't, I couldn't afford the Red Lobster. [LAUGHTER] What anyway?	Oh god! You are damn cheap, cheap, cheap. Anyways, moving on. It's not like you're poor. I mean your dad makes... okey	So Okay then and.	I got all the character animals to do a conga line,	dim down the lights and uh, I got on one of the tables pulled her up.	You had the mouse?	Isn't it a rat? It's a rat. Chuck E. Cheese?	Yeah.	Chucky...I don't know. I don't know. Anyways, I pull her up and I go, I go Sarah	You're my guiding light, then they put on that song the I've had the time of my life, that song.	Okay, that is really cheesy Joe.	Oh that's kind of sweet.	Wait, wait, wait I want you to marry me? No, shouldn't you like be more like a question like, would you marry me? Not like I want you to marry me. It's like a demand.	You marry me. I man I Jane, you Tarzan.	She said sure?	Sure? Who says sure? You say yes...I don't like--	How long have you guys been going out?	About two and a half weeks.	Two and ... We love each other. Yeah.	You got to meet her, she's wonderful.	She just graduated from high school and----she's planning to apply for colleges----and stuff.She's so great. She has so much life and energy and stuff.	She must be hot.	Yeah, she is good-looking.	I'm twenty eight years old.	You still act like a boy. And men take a lot longer to grow----I will tell you.	I'm so excited. It's going to be great.	I'm still working at my parents' restaurant. Busing tables.	Oh that's great. My mom said we can move in with her again if we run out of money.	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	2	5	2	0	2	2	2	2	2	2	0	2	2	2	2	2	5	5	2	2	2	0	2	2	2	2	2	0	0	5	0	2
Hey. How's it going? I haven't seen you in awhile.	What's going on Joe?	Guess who got into U.S.C.?	Me. Yeah, I did.	Yeah.	I got into the...	I got into cinema production.	Yeah.	No. It's like it's harder than getting into Harvard.	What does that mean?	You're going to be here and I'm going to be in LA so we can be together now. I mean we can be in the same city.	Holy shit...	We can party. We can have fun.	This will be like high school but even better.	Yeah. Hopefully it won't be like high school.	Oh man I am so proud of you, that is...how did you get...I mean what did you do? How did you find out or what...?	I have some bad news. I was like what? She's like not really you got into U.S.C. and I was like, I was like oh my God. I was about to tear my own hair out.	Oh man.	Yeah. This is so crazy. I mean I didn't get into any other school but I got into the school I wanted.	Did you say yes yet? I mean have you sent in your answer?	Oh my God the first minute I got it I sent it back in.	All right.	So...	This is so great, you know, because I gone fit on downtown so I'm going to be like right here. I think I'm going to be living at City Lights downtown.	This is so exciting. This is like a new chapter in our lives.	Yeah, it really is.	We're doing what we want to do, then four years later we're going to be working professionals, making money, sipping martinis every day.	Man I'm just so happy for you. I just--	Thank you	Well, I'm happy for you but I'm happy for me cause that means you're going to stay.	And tonight my parents want to take me out to sushi and they said I could bring you.	Oh great. I would love to go.	Yeah and they said get whatever you want and...	Mmmm some miso soup.	Some miso soup. You can get whatever. You can get a vat full of miso soup. God.	This is going to be so great. I have so many great ideas.	It took them, oh man, it took them like, I mean what it's like April now and any letters that come in April are usually the rejection letters so I was just like...	Oh my God. I am so proud of you.	2	2	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	2	5	5	2	2	2	5	2	5	2	5	2	5	5	5	2	5	5	5	2	5	5	2	0
Look at this, goose bumps.	Well so what'd you think?	What I said.	Certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?	Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.	Well what's bugging you?	We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.	There's nothing to it. We come down here. The grunions arrive. They do their little fish business. We go ooh, ah, look at the fish. They go home. We go home.	We never do, do we? Have we ever?	Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.	We'll see them this year.	You don't have any idea what I'm saying.	No, of course, not.	I did want to see it. I always do. I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.	It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.	I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.	You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see, I took a shower. Uh, you watched the news. You said the grunions are running tonight. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.	Uh,okay. So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;	uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.	Uh.	It was about four years ago, right after we got married. We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses. You asked me to dance. So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.	Wait a minute, I've got it.	Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.	It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker? You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that. Right? That's it, right? You want this to be like the other time. That's it. Of course.	I'd rather not remember some things. I'd rather not hope for some things.	No.	No.	What, you want me to breathe in your ear?	No.	You want to get married again?	No.	What, you want a divorce?	No.	A vacation?	No.	I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.	Well welcome to the human race. You think this is what I had in mind? You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish? No.	And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla? You know what you get? This.	This what? What is this? This isn't even anything.	Yes, it is.	Oh, right, sure. This is standing on the beach. This is waiting. This is fighting.	Right.	But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	No, I know, me neither.	I'm doing the best I can.	I know you are, Augie. Really, I do. I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything. But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	No, I know. But still. I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it, no. I don't.	Okay, fine. So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.	I don't know. It seemed like a good spot to me. I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.	Yeah, I noticed that.

Oh, you're never going to believe it.	What? What? You look really happy what's going on?	Well, I finally did it	Finally did what?	Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did M: God.	Did she say yes?	Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know	That's like the most definitive.	I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.	Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised?	Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know	I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now.	Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah	so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-	Oh, You did not.	I-I did.	Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute	That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God.	I know, so	I got to freak her out.	No, yes -- so	She must have flipped out.	Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.	Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER]	No, but it was good.	Did you bring her up on stage too?	Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]	Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.	I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.	Are your parents excited or...?	Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...	Ooh, that would be fun.	Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first	Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool.	I know.	Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]	Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand. F: That's so fun. Oh my gosh.	Sure. Oh, yes. F: Good. F: Good, good, good, good.	Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah	Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.	Hah.	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	2	5	2	5	5	2	2	5	5	2	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	5	5	5	5	5	2	2	5	5	2
D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?	Hi, I need- I need some help. I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on. And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks. And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.	This happens every two weeks?	Yeah. That my service just goes out.	You've lost your connection.	yeah.	okay.	And I'll reset the IP address. I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-	Hmm. Mmm.	Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.	Has somebody tried to pin your site?	Uh, yeah. We've pinned it a couple of times.	Okay. Um- Well, I don't know. And it consistently happens every two weeks?	Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.	Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?	Hmm. Mmm.	Okay. Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows? I mean, is it --	yeah.	It goes- It goes, like, through doorways. But it goes a long distance.	Okay. Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance? Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.	Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection. And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.	Well, I- I can check that. Is there anything else we can do, too? Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --	Yeah, well, absolutely. What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay. Can you go down to your start button?	Uh huh.	Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run.	All right.	Okay. We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up. Do you see that?	Yeah, I see that.	Okay Uh- You've got your C calling, go ahead and type in directory list.	Okay.	And hit enter.	Okay.	Okay? Can you tell me what that says?	Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.	Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff. Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.	Uh huh, Okay.	Okay? Does it list your IP address there?	Uh, yeah looks -- no, no. It's set to zeros.	It's set to zeros. Okay, maybe that's our problem. That could very well be our problem there. Somehow you've lost your IP address. I'm not sure why that would happen every week. It could be a cycling issue, something like that. But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.	Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me. Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --	Of course. we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.	Oh, my God. I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is. I literally call and talk to five different people. Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people. And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.	I completely understand.	It's so frustrating.	Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.	Absolutely. It's a new service we are offering.	Yeah, accountability. It's awesome.	Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy. You're our customer. You're the most important thing. Okay?	Wow. You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.	Great. Well, that makes me very happy. That makes us all happy here at D.S.L. Extreme. Is there anything else I can help you with?	No. I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.	All right. You have a wonderful day. Call us anytime.	Okay. Thanks.	All right.

You knew there was nothing in that.	Only a trivial little broach.	You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	maybe just a little, but--	You let him kiss you. You said you did.	And what of it?	What of it?	Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.	Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.	So am I, bored stiff. Would you like some brandy?	I'll have a little I think.	I don't see why you want any. You've already had three glasses.	Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.	It's becoming a habit with you.	You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	Really, Amanda.	Just making myself fascinating for you.	Oh, that reply has broken my heart.	Oh, yes it is.	It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	adder don't snap, they sting.	They sting.	They snap.	I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.	[BREATHING]	Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	Yes, I did quite a bit.	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.	Mind your own business.	You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable. I mean, you never had much anyway.	Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable. I would imagine it's because you're drunk.	Oh, You are so insufferable. Do you stop.	Oh, This is very interesting. We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.	Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.	Ugh.	You better turn that off I think.	Why?	There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.	They're away in Tunis.	Turn it on again.	Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.	Turn it off. It is driving me mad.	Well, do try to control yourself darling.	Turn it off.	You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.	Turn it off.	I- I hate you.	Amanda-- Listen- Listen-	I hate you.	No, no. I'm tired of listening to you. You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.	Very music- amusing indeed.	Yeah, very amusing. Let me go. I'm getting out of here. I can't believe I intended to marry you.	You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.	Oh, marry you again? I must have been insane. What was I thinking? I mean, you're completely outrageous.	Shut up, shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.	Beast; brute; cad; whore	0	0	0	4	0	4	0	1	0	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	4	4	0	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	0	4	4	4	4	1	1	4	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
Well, so what do you think?	About what?	What I was saying.	It's ridiculous.	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?	God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.	Well, what's bugging you?	We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	There's nothing to it. We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish. They go home. We go home.	For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.	Why not?	We never do, do we? I mean, have we ever?	We've missed them twice. That's not ever.	Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.	Well, we'll see them this year.	No, we won't. It's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.	I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up. And the fish won't show up.	I thought you wanted to see it.	You don't understand anything I'm saying.	No, of course not.	I did want to see it. I always do. I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.	It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized about.	All right. Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.	You said, Hey the grunion are running tonight. I said, Great, let's go. I feel lucky.	Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--	Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago, right after we got married.	I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses. You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.	And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking, this is it. You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Wait a minute. I've got it.	Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne, and I said, time's a wasting or something like that, right?	Yeah, of course, I see it now. You want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?	I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.	Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now. Listen, you wanna dance?	No.	You want me to go get some champagne?	No.	Take off our shoes?	Well, what? You want me to breathe in your ear?	No.	You wanna get married again?	No.	What? What? You want a divorce?	No.	A vacation?	No.	A new carpet? A poodle? Ice cream? Back rub? A suicide pact? What? What? Carla, what the hell do you want? F: No.	Well, welcome to the human race. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?	No, Carla, I'm just like you. I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us	'cause you know what you get, Carla? You know what you get? This.	Yes, it is.	Right.	Well. This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	I know, me neither.	I'm doing the best I can.	I know that, Augie. Really, I do.	I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.	I didn't say that.	No, I know. But still. I know I don't make you happy.	You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else. Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.	I don't know. It seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.	Well, look what we have here.	Augie, you brought refreshments.	It's not champagne.	Well, then we don't need glasses.	No. I think you might be right. Maybe this is the spot after all.	Augie, I'm sorry.	Shh. If we're very quiet the fish might come.	Or not.	Or not.	5	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	1	4	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	4	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	3	3	3	3	0	3	0	0	3	0	3	0	3	0	1	3	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	3	1	0	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	3	2	2	2
Now and always sweet.	I don't care then.	It had to happen sooner or later.	[BREATHING]	Oh. Behave exquisitely...	With perfect poise...	[LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.	Ah...	[LAUGHTER]	Ah...Strange...	Mmm...	Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they?	Darling, don't say that.	Oh, yes meaning just that.	Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?	[LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious.	You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want.	Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.	Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.	How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?	We are figures of fun all right M: Mmhmm...	Ahh...who knows.	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	If one of us dies... F: Hmm...	I think you're talking nonsense.	Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh? Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay? Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]	Come here darling, kiss me	before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets. M: [LAUGHTER] Ahh...	See, you know I don't care what you do. You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome. M: Ahh...	Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?	Which particular one?	Oh, Charles. That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.	But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.	Cannes...mmhmm...	The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor. [LAUGHTER]	I will never forget the look on his face.	Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...	oh...	Utterly, utterly ridiculous.	oh...[LAUGHTER]	We were very much younger then.	Very much sillier.	Oh you knew there was nothing in that.	2	2	2	5	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	5	5	2	2	2	2	5	5	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	5
Why did he invite her here?	Why does that bother you?	Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.	Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.	uh-uh What do you mean? They grew up next to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her?	Hey don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you.	Who said he even thought about that?	Well, so what?	Now listen kid...	No. She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.	How do you know why she's waited? Hmmm?	I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.	My worst times I think about her, you know, and I	it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.	Look at how nice the day is. What are we arguing for?	No. Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith. You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.	What do you want me to do? What do you want?	But Kate...	Laugh, laugh at me but I will. Because you know what happened when she came here? When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.	Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.	Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.	Alright, alright, calm yourself okay? Calm yourself. Wait, wait. What do you mean, me above all?	Wait, what does that mean? Me above all?	Look at you, you're shaking.	I can't help it.	What do I got to hide? Huh? What the hell's the matter with you Kate?	4	1	4	0	1	1	0	0	1	4	0	4	3	3	1	4	1	1	4	1	3	4	4	4	3	4
Fine.	Okay. Is that, is that--	[BREATHING] F: [Mumbles something]	The flashlight, the silver one. There's only one, isn't there?	That's not your flashlight.	Whose is it?	Oh...well. Yeah, of course.	You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.	No.	How's that supposed to make me feel?	Of course, our flashlight. What's yours is mine. Me flashlight es su flashlight.	Naturally. God, how could we not think to bring it? I hope the moon stays out, though.	Do they always run during a full moon? I don't remember. Was it full last year?	Yeah.	Huh. Are you cold? Do you want my jacket? No? you know, we should have brought the blanket? Our blanket.	Aw. Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too. A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now. Huh?	God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid. I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up. M: Uh oh.	[LAUGHTER]	I'm cold.	Do you want my jacket?	Right.	Wait, that's my point, too.	Well, then let's go.	No, no. Okay. That's not my point. My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home. Don't you want to see it?	Not particularly.	Why not?	Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this. It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.	Pass what up? I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.	Yeah. But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives. All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.	This is a big night for these little guys. It's like life's last orgy.	Yeah they do.	Oh Augie	There's like mystery here, there's magic. It's like a little bit of the unexplainable. I just can't see how you're not interested.	Yeah.	God, I don't get it. you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?	And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.	Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.	Hmm. We didn't see them the year before either.	We just weren't in a good spot. I'm telling you, this is a much better spot. I have instincts for these things. F: [Mumbles] Oh yeah.	Look there, see? What's that? No, that's - that's just seaweed.	God, this is great. Think about this. I know you are not interested, but just think about this.	Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast. And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.	It's single mindedness with no mind. It is urgency that is just pure urge.	That's the wind.	So what do you think?	About what?	About all of that, about all I was talking about.	0	5	1	0	0	0	0	4	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	5	2	3	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	5	2	5	5	0	2	0	2
That's helpful.	I just don't think I can do this anymore. It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying.	Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.	I am try- it's been three years	and I have gone everywhere I can think of. I have given resumes. I have done interviews. I've tried to pull in favors. I've asked everybody I know for help. I don't know what else to do.	Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.	I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-	I don't know.	Okay but I've been trying for three years. Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough. Thank you very much.	Hey. Look, I mean- you know.	I'm really good at what I do. I just don't know how to make someone else see that.	Look bananas don't grow overnight. Okay.	What? Who says that? Bananas don't grow overnight.	You need that- Time-	You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job. I mean-	Okay. I think three years is a little excessive.	look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-	Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job. I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something. I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.	I don't know. I mean whatever.	Nothing I'm trying seems to work. Just-	Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.	I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.	Well don't you understand that this is-	Yeah, I understand, but-	I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea. Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.	I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-	I mean it's not like this is an	extreme request. I want to find a job. Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.	Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.	Okay. Okay, Fine.	'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-	Okey So I'm doing something wrong. What am I doing wrong?	I'm really good at what I do. I'm smart. I'm trained. I have the education. I'm talented. I cannot-	Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?	Well yeah I mean I like take a shower and stuff.	And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?	[LAUGHTER] Yeah. Usually.	and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair. I mean- I don't know, it's like,	Yeah, I- I make my	I make myself very presentable before I go to any kind of interview.	you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.	or some- some large percent of- of success.	Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah, yeah. Good quote. M: Yeah	Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it. Keep trying. Go-	Buck-O. That's really helpful. Just keep chugging along. The little engine that could. M: Yeah, just-	Well you- just you're doing something wrong.	Look if I could give you a job,if I could give you a job I would but I mean I'm not in that position. I'm-	Well maybe you could help. I mean you've got a job. I'm willing to look outside of my realm. I could try something else.	Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-	I'll get it. I just need a job. I don't care what it is.	So, go to McDonalds.	Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper.	Well you've got to start somewhere. I mean-	I did start somewhere. I worked my way up. I'm not going to start at the bottom again.	Well you're going to have to. You don't really have an option. What's your problem?	What's my problem? What's my problem? I don't have a job.	I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-	I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.	I'm trying to be helpful.	Well maybe you could be a little helpful. I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.	I'm trying to watch TV.	That's important. That's really important.	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	4	0	4	0	0	1	0	4	1	1	4	0	1	0	4	0	4	4	0	4	0	4	4	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	4	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	4	0	4	0	1	0	1
So guess what.	what	I got into college.	Shut up. What'd you get, where'd you get accepted to? please	U.S.C..	Oh, sweet.	yeah.	So you're not going to leave me.	No.	oh, good good good good good good.	I'll stay in town.	Are you going to live on campus? Where are you going to live?	Uh- I don't know.	Uh! stay over here. Like travel to school. because you are so close to me	Well, I don't want to, I don't want to live with my mom.	Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right, right. Maybe we should get a place together.	Whoa. What an idea. Where would you want to live?	That'll be awesome.	I don't know. Well. I wouldn't mind living by the U.S.C. campus, you know, but I'm not going to go to school right now, so.	But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you.	Whoa, this is going to be so much fun.	it is going to be so much fun. Yes.	Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away.	Thank you. I know, I'm really, really, really excited.	Oh, I bet you're going to love it too. You always wanted to go to U.S.C..	I know they have a really, really great program for what I want to do.	You're going to have so much fun. And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together.	Can we for real live together?	Sure, why not. I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want.	awesome.	So should we get a place near campus? or-	That'll be great. That'll be great.	We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though. Do you know any people that might be out there?	okay.	Yeah, me either.	[garbage] I know, I know, I know, we'll figure it out. Right? [garbage] it is going to be so much fun.	It's going to be ridiculous. It's going to be so cool.	You can't make fun of me because I'm not going to school, though, because I'm going to be working though.	[LAUGHTER] Oh, I'm going to be working too, I mean.	I- I hear the same.	Woo- I I do.	I don't know how I feel about that, but-	I know exactly how you feel about that. I think you feel really excited about it. I know you are. I can tell. I know you.	oh yeah.	oh yeah.	You're a wild and crazy woman.	[LAUGHTER] Oh, it'll be awesome, that's for sure.	Uh huh, it will be awesome.	Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.	living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad.	[LAUGHTER] by yourself.	you'd be that kid	living near campus, and not going to school.	Exactly. Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much.	[LAUGHTER]	Oh, it's going to be so much fun.	yeah.	Well, congratulations. and to me too, because now I get to-have-	We should go apartment shop-er-hunting.	That's a good idea.	Let's go tomorrow.	Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow-	yeah.	Good. We'll have to have one soon, you're going to have to go to school in a couple of months.	Woo-	Oh God, it's awesome... There's going to be tons of places.

Why did you invite her here?	She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-	Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.	You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.	How do you know he's even thinking about it?	It's got that about it.	Well, so what?	Listen, kid-	She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.	You can't read her mind.	How do you know why she's waited?	She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-	Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?	Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.	Calm yourself.	Calm yourself.	Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.	Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.	All right. All right. Calm yourself.	Okay. Just calm yourself.	No, you've got to believe.	Why me, above all?	Huh?	Why me above all?	You got to keep believing.	Look at you, you're shaking.	I can't help it.	What have I got to hide?	Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?	4	4	0	4	0	4	0	1	4	0	0	3	0	4	0	1	4	4	4	1	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4
Why did he invite her here?	Oh, God, line.	Why does that bother you?	She's been in New York three and a half years. Why, all of a sudden--	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	What do you mean? He grew up next door to the girl all his life. Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?	He's not going to marry her.	How do you know he's even thinking about it?	It's got that about it.	Well so what?	What's going on here, Joe?	Line.	Now listen, kid. Now, listen.	She's not his girl, Joe. She knows she's not.	Then why is she still single? New York is full of men. Why hasn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.	Because she knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.	Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	What do you want me to do? What do you want? F: I want--	I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here. I won't stand for any nonsense.	But, Kate--	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.	Laugh. Laugh at me. But why did that happen the very night that she came here?	She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces. Look. Look at it. Joe--	Calm yourself.	Believe with me, Joe. I can't stand all alone	Calm yourself.	Alright, alright. Calm yourself.	You, above all, have got to believe. You.	Why me above all?	I can't help it.	What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	4	0	0	4	4	1	4	0	4	0	4	0	0	4	4	4	1	4	1	4	1	4	4	4	1	4	1	1	4	1	3	4
Uh, God. I don't know what to do anymore. Like I said --	I don't know. There's nothing for me out there. I can't get a job. I haven't gotten a job in a year, three years. What is it, three years now; right? That I haven't been able to have a job.	Really? It's been that long?	Something like that. I can't even remember anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. I just get out there everyday -- well, not everyday, almost everyday.	Wow.	And try to do something. I mean-	What have you been trying?	Well, everything. I'll do temping, you know, office work. You know, whatever to pay the bills. You know, I'll do anything.	But, I mean, I don't want to keep those jobs. I don't want those jobs.It's not what I want to do.	Right.	But, I don't know. God, what am I going to do? Should I go back to school? I can't- I can't afford to go back to school.	What do you do?	Well, I mean, right now I'm just doing a little bit of everything. And I don't- I don't think that I'm in like a profession, like career oriented place.	You plan on being there forever? I mean, Like, what do you --	No. I'm just working in restaurants and stuff. But, I'm also trying to audition and what not. So, it's --	yeah.	right.	Yeah, yeah. Well, hello. That's what I'm doing too. But I can't get the restaurant job. I can't get -- -- the restaurant gig. No one will give me anything.	Really?	I go in for these interviews, and they're all cool and everything, you know. Their nice and I'm nice to them, you know, give and take, back and forth, and whatever.	But they always go with somebody else.	L.A. is really hard. I mean, have you tried like just going into a bar a couple of times to make friends with people who work there? and	Yeah, absolutely. Hello? You know me. I go to bars all the time. Like, they all know me, you know. But no one wants to hire me.	but Maybe they don't want to hire me because they know me. I don't know, what's wrong with me, Is there something wrong with me?	I was just going to say that's your issue. Maybe you are going in too much. No, I mean, just	are you going into the bars every night?	I mean, You can tell me what. Why is no one hiring me? Is it me? Be honest. You can tell me. you know I can take it. I can take it, you just tell me. Why?	Well, I don't really know. I don't I don't know you in like a job situation, so.	Yeah, but I'm -- okay, well how about personality wise? I mean, people who know me won't hire me. Why?	Wow. I don't -- I mean, do you- do you have an attitude problem when you're on the job?	Maybe [garbage].	Right. Maybe you have, like, you know a little bit of an abrasive vibe or something.	An abrasive vibe?	I don't know. I'm I'm just trying --	Let me know that's -- that's fine. You think I have an abrasive vibe, whatever. You're entitled to your opinion, of course. Maybe that's why I don't have a job.	Are you getting defensive?	Yeah. That might be something you want to look at. I mean --	I'm not like this all the time. I mean, I don't -- I'm just frustrated right now, all right. I just want to do --	Okay.	I want to make some money. I need to make some money. I've got to pay some bills, I owe people money. I owe lots of people money. I need to make some money.	I understand.	Yeah, it's stressful. I recognize that.	Do you have any idea how I can make money? I mean, what can I do to make some quick money, something? Anything, that's relatively within the you know law.	ah.	Not- Not selling pot, right?	Right, probably not selling pot. I don't want to go to jail.	Okay so.	Fair enough.	Because that would just really be a topper for me.	Thank you. Ha ha.	Sorry. So, let's see. What else? What's available? What? Um. Hmm.	See what I mean? You can't even think of anything.	Well, not off the top of head. It will just take you know take a minute. But do you have any, like, special skills?	I can juggle.	Well, maybe we can find you something with juggling.	I've tried.	Have you checked out Craig's List and stuff?	Yes! Nobody wants a juggler. I am not going to -- I'm not going to dress up like a clown. I'm not going to dress up like a freaking clown. No.	What if you do kids parties? oh, come on.	No, it's demeaning. I am not a clown. I have talent. Clowns don't have talent.	Okay. All right.	It's that simple.	Okay. Well, fine. we won't- I won't argue with you about that.	yeah.	What else? I can't -- uh. I'm drawing a blank here.	You and me both.	That's rough. I'm really sorry, Ryan.	Well, um, is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?	No, I just showed that for you [garbage].	Okay. Well, that's good. Yeah, I mean, you're you're- when you're happy you're a pretty personable guy. And I don't --I don't	I like to think so.	I can't see where the issue would be. so	see.	Yeah, well thanks for your help.

Welcome to Northwest Airlines. How can I help you?	You guys lost my bag.	Did you file a complaint already?	Yeah. Yeah I did.	Where? Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?	I-I don't know. The place where they told me to go. Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag. Not it's late. Not it will be here soon, lost it completely. What are you going to do about that?	Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down. Second of all-	Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.	Lost it just, like, I mean,	Ma'am, I understand that.	it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention	because my bag was very easy to keep track of. It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.	I understand that. The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage.	At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you-	No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.	You're kidding me, right. You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through. I paid for my ticket. All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff. Is that so much to ask? I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up. M: Ma'am, ma'am.	you're getting very excited right now	Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.	I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now.	Look fifty dollars is unacceptable. My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars. You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough. Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars. My bag is worth more than that.	What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.	If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.	We're just talking over each other.	We're not going to communicate anything this way.	I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.	Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to	sign away your luggage to the	I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-	It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you-	You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff. Fifty dollars is unacceptable.	Ma'am, please calm down. When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement,	No. No. I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what? That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.	terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over	The best that we can do for you is give you-	Ma'am.	I want to talk to your supervisor.	I am- I am- I am my own supervisor.	I've had enough. I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.	I am the supervisor, ma'am.	Really, you don't work for anybody. It's just you?	I am the current manager on duty.	Okay. Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.	Ma'am, I own Northwest Airlines.	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	4	4	1	1	4	4	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	1	4	1
About what?	About what I was just saying.	It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.	Are we talking about the same thing?	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?	Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.	Okay, then what's bugging you?	Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.	There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home.	We're not seeing the grunions?	Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come.	We missed them twice. That's not ever.	We'll see them this time.	Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.	God, I thought you wanted to see it.	I do.	Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens.	It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.	For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.	I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.	You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.	And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-	Do you remember the last time we came here?	We thought I was pregnant.	You brought a bottle of champagne.	We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.	And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.	Oh, that moment-that was it.	I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.	Wait a minute. I got it.	Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.	I don't want to remember something.	Hope for some things.	No.	No.	No, no.	What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?	No.	Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?	No.	No.	A vacation?	No.	A new carpet? A poodle?	A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?	I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.	Jesus, welcome to the human race.	No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.	You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.	This what? What is this? This is nothing.	Yes, it is.	No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.	Right.	Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.	No, I know. Me neither.	it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?	Well, I'm doing the best I can.	I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.	Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.	I didn't say that.	Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you.	God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more.	Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.	Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.	Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.	I noticed that. It's beautiful.	You can see right over the water.	Look what we got here.	It's not champagne.	At least we won't need glasses.	Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?	Maybe this is the right place after all.	I'm sorry, Augie.	Shh.	If we're very quiet the fish might come.	Or not.	0	0	1	1	1	0	4	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	3	3	2	2	2	3	0	2	3	3	3	3	3	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	3	1	3	1	3	1	3	1	1	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	0	2	3	0	2	2
Hi. Excuse me. Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration.	Hi.	Okay. Let me see here. Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate.	Right. Well. We still need it.	No it doesn't say it on the form.	I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification.	I mean if I had known--I would have brought it.	um Sorry.	Okay. Um, I'm sorry but I--I can't help you. You're gonna have to go back and uh...	Look, I've been waiting in line for a really long time. I mean, you've seen how long it is.	It's lunch hour.	Right. It's the D.M.V..	I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe?	Well, no. I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again.	I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have.	Alright, I don't know what to tell you right.	I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out. Maybe, we can-	But, isn't there anything you can do. Can't you make an exception this one time? My picture is on both of those identifications. It's not like you don't know that it's me.	I can't.	And I can give you my social--	I make an exception for you and I have to make an exception for everyone. I mean, I-I've seen this before and I know it's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do. You just have to-	Well, I can give you my Social Security Number.	No, it's--	And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day.	Okay. But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me. How do I know that, you know, that it's really you. I need--	I can't go--I have to go back to work. I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes.	Well, the weekends are not as busy. Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early--	Um, I have kids. I have to take them places on the weekends. I don't have time to come back here. Please. I really need you to help me.	I can't. There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.	Well. [BREATHING] I just--I just don't. I-I'm sorry that I'm standing here-- But I can't leave. I-	I really need this done today. As you can see, the deadline is almost up and I can't come back.	Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting	Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?	I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification--	You know, Official documentation--	Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate? Nobody does that.	No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured--	With your driver's license and your passport. Just like everybody else.	But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license? I mean, you need--you needed something before then?	Who--you always use your driver's license. I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.	All right. Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do.	So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe. I don't know.	Do you have a supervisor?	I am the supervisor. So--	Well, thank you very much. You've been very helpful. M: All right. Thank you.	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	1	4	4	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	1
He saw it.	Did you talk to him?	No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again. He's walking around at night.	I don't know the meaning of this, mom. But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.	Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	What do you want to do, argue with him?	I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.	You can't say that to him.	We've got to say it to him.	How are you going to prove it? Can you prove it?	For God's sake three years. Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.	To you it is and to me but not to him. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?	Sit down mom. I want to talk to you.	The trouble is the goddamn newspapers. Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.	Alright, alright, alright. Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?	You know why.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Well that's only your business, Chris.	You know it's not only my business.	What do you want me to do? You're old enough to know your own mind.	Then it's alright. I'll go ahead with it.	Then it isn't just my business.	I'm just saying.	Sometimes you infuriate me. You know that? Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.	Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.	I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.	She's not Larry's girl.	From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.	Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go. See I don't know. Now what can I do for you?	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.	You're a considerate fellow. There's nothing wrong in that.	To hell with that.	I wanted to get this settled first.	How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way father does.	Well if she does, then that's the end of it. From her letters, I think she's forgotten him. I'll find out.	and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom. Don't avoid me.	The trouble is you don't see enough women. You never did.	So what I'm not fast with women.	I don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything. You haven't seen her since you went to war. It's been five years.	These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?	I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back, Chris.	You marry that girl. You're pronouncing him dead. Now what happens to your father? Do you know because I don't?	I've given it three years of thought. I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry	and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding. But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.	Are you crazy?	You've got a business here. What the hell is this?	The business, the business doesn't inspire me.	Must you be inspired?	Yes, I like it an hour a day. If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.	I want- I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I give myself to. Annie is in the middle of that. Now where do I find it?	You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?	Then you help me stay here.	Alright but don't think that way	because what the hell did we work for? This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.	I know. Just you help me stay here.	But don't think that way. You hear me?	Yeah. I can see that.	0	3	3	3	1	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	1	0	0	0	1	4	1	4	1	4	4	4	1	4	4	1	0	4	3	1	1	4	1	4	4	4	4	3	1	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	1	1	1	1	4	4	1	4	4
Excuse me.	Do you have your forms?	Yeah.	Let me see them.	Is there a problem?	Who told you to get in this line?	Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.	Well what's the problem? Let me change it.	This form is a Z.X.four.	You can't-- This is not the line for Z.X.four. If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.	What? I'm getting an ID. This is why I'm here. My wallet was stolen.	No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.	How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID? How does a person get an ID in the first place?	I don't know. But I need an ID to pass this form along. I can't just send it along without an ID.	I'm here to get an ID.	No. I need another ID, a separate one.	Like what? Like a birth certificate?	A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school? Anything?	Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything. I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID. Don't you have things on file here?	Yeah. We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file.	That's out of control.	I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here. It's just a simple form. I just need an ID.	How long have you been working here?	Clearly. You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?	Yeah. Do you want to see my supervisor? Huh? Yeah. Do you want to see my supervisor? Fine. I'll be right back.	That would - I would appreciate that. Yeah.	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	1	0	4	1
[BREATHING]	Do you think it's them?	We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.	Then I don't care.	things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?	Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.	[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.	Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.	Oh dear, well, shall we want that?	Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?	Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.	Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.	yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.	That was a rouser, wasn't it?	The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]	I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.	0	0	0	0	5	5	5	5	3	3	5	5	5	2	2	5	2	5
Hi. Um-	Hi, can I help you?	It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.	Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-	Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour.	Okay. Well, um- the f.	Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-	Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know	Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-	Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that	Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.	Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.	I really - I really need that bag.	I- I- I understand, but um.	Okay	I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there	Right.	I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-	Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane	can they check there?	Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and	they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.	So we'll- what we'll do	But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and	see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-	Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.	Um, so.	Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-	We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know	I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.	This is unbelievable. I've got	you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay	I understand, so-	so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do	I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?	all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage	and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-	You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage]	I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.	Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-	Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on	that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.	The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-	The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-	Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have	we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-	I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do	because this is ridiculous?	I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-	All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.

As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	You knew there was nothing in that.	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	Presents, just a trivial little broach.	No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	You let him kiss you; you said you did.	What of it?	It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.	What about me?	Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.	I'm bored of this conversation.	No thanks.	I have a little I think.	No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.	It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.	Well, it's become a habit with you.	What?	Nothing.	No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.	Going out somewhere, dear?	As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	Oh, no it isn't.	Be quiet.	Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.	Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	They snap.	I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.	Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	Yes, I did quite a lot.	What riotous time you must have had.	No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.	Oh be quiet.	We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.	All right. I will.	Better turn that off I think.	I'll do no such thing.	Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.	Turn it off.	Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.	Amanda, listen. Listen.	Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.	Very amusing indeed.	Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.	You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.	This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.	You're not going like this.	Oh yes I am.	You're not.	Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.	Shut up.	Shut up.	I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.	You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.	0	5	4	5	0	4	0	4	0	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	1	0	0	0	1	4	1	1	1	4	0	0	4	4	4	4	0	0	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.	What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life. Why wouldn't he want to see her again?	How do you know he's even thinking of it?	It's got that all about it.	Well, so what?	Now, listen Kate.	You can't read her mind.	Well then why is she still single? I mean, New York is full of men. Why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.	How do you know why she's waited?	She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?	Well, what do you want me to do about it?	I want you to act like he's coming back. Both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here. I won't stand for any nonsense.	But Kate--	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...	But why did that happen the very night she came here? She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces. Just look. Look at it.	Calm yourself.	Believe with me, Joe. I can't stand all alone.	Calm yourself.	Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry. I mean, you read it yourself.	All right. All right. Calm yourself.	You, above all, have to believe.	Just--just don't stop believing.	What does that mean? Me above all?	Look at you. Look at you shaking.	I can't help it.	What have I got to hide?

Yeah, hi. Look--Um, okay. Here's the thing.	Hi, how can I help you?	Mmhmm.	lost my luggage. Your airline--	I'm sorry.	Right.	lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it.	It was lost. I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out.	Didn't come out. I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure. F: Mmhmm.	And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss.	'Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth.	Uh. Okay. I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag.	Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar	fifty dollars?	refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes	fifty dollars. No way, no.	That's our policy, sir.	I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.	You understand? F: Uh huh.	What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people. Okay. You can write -- you can just put my name on all --	I can't do that.	But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do.	No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says. I mean--	I'm very sorry. I understand you're frustrated. You just got off of a flight.	You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.	You--	We'll cover fifty.	No. No. No. What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.	We only cover fifty do-	Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.	We only cover fifty dollars worth of lost items.	And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just-	I'm very sorry.	I'm very sorry. I understand you're upset. You just got off a long flight.	You don't understand. You don't understand, actually. You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost. Okay.	We really -- we want to work with you. We really -- we want to help.	I understand that. I would know if it was mine. Um-	Yeah. If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine. Okay. So just--	But it's not. It's yours. I understand.	I know. We want to work with you. We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--	Yeah, we don't do that. I can go ahead and send you--	You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me. You're going to do that.	We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it. We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items.	Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please? 'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,	No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that.	I can write you the one check.	but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.	All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.	But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--	But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person	I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too.	We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.	then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see? F: Okay, they-. Uh huh.	No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that.	But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.	And your bag is not my concern.	The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.	Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this. Like--	I'm more than happy to not argue about it. I will give you your fifty dollar certificate.	You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.	So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms	with different names on them? That-	Then that would be lying.	but, no. See, 'cause	if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.	I'm sorry. We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.	Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but	I understand you're frustrated, but--	um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please.	I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.	Please.	But if you want to just sit down, you know, maybe have a cup of tea, calm down a little bit, we'll go ahead and we'll do what we can for you. you okey	I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.	Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever. I'll never -- we'll never see each other again. F: Okay	And I'm looking forward to that. However, I can't do that. I would lose my job.	But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.	Oh, yes.	But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.	I'm sorry, really. But--	I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.	That I'm sorry?	Yeah. If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.	So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm? Hmm?	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	4	0	4	0	4	4	1	0	1	4	1	4	4	0	4	1	4	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	4	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	4
Kathy died last night.	yeah, I mean, you know, it was a -	I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder.	It doesn't make any easier, yes.	I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,	Oh, man. I'm so sorry.	She was with- yeah She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it.	It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.	Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but	God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go	Yeah.	out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean.	Totally.	It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know	Yeah	not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.	Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.	She was [garbage]	She really cared about you, you know.	Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great	so loving everybody you know.	And she was	Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go.	Yeah.	We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.	Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.	Yes. [BREATHING] God.	Are you going to be okay?	I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it	just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.	Then she's gone.	It's going to be okay, I promise.	Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps	Sure	to talk to somebody but	you shouldn't be alone	It's just going to take a while, I think.	Yes.	Ah.	Thank you.	Yes.	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3
What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	He saw it.	He was out here when it broke.	Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out. We're standing right there when I cracked.	I don't know. but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.	Did you talk to him?	No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.	He cried hard.	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	He is thinking about him again.	It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.	I guess, he is.	What's the meaning of that?	I don't know the meaning of it. But I know one thing mom did. We made a terrible mistake with dad.	Being dishonest with him. It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it. So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um. Do we contradict him? Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?	We have to say it to him!	For God's sake, mom, three years. Nobody comes back after three years! It's insane!	To you it is, and to me, but not to your father. Now look, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?	Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.	All right, All right mom. Listen!	You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?	You know.	Well I got an idea. But what's the story?	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	You know that's not just my business.	So it's all right. I can go ahead with it then?	I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.	Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do. I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.	I don't know why it is. But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.	To hell with that!	Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?	Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have	So what, I'm not fast with women.	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	I can't help it. I know her best. I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie. Do you want a diagram?	No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.	You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead. Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know? I don't.	All right, then, Mom.	I've given it three years of thought. And hope by now that he wouldn't. Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy. But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.	What the hell is this?	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else. Maybe, maybe New York?	Are you crazy?	Wait a minute. Tell me this. Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?	The business? The business? It doesn't inspire me?	Don't- you, you can't think like that! Don't think like that!	All right! But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris? The whole business it's all for you! The whole shooting match is for you!	I don't understand you, do I?	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	3	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	4	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	3	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	1	4	1

I'm so excited.	Well, Tell me about him. What happened. M: Uh huh. Yeah. M: Oh, the beach. M: Lights? M: To the--	like all they have And I was like, what's going on? And he like takes my hand and pulls me into the middle and he's like--you know, get's on his knee and everything--And says will you marry me? And I flipped out. M: Wow. No. M: No way.	'Cause- 'Cause he was with me. You didn't do it did you?	Yeah. I mean candles wouldn't stay--No, I didn't--I didn't know anything about it.	You didn't know anything?	No. I'm just as happy as you are.

Only a trivial little broach.	Not at all. I quite like it. I wear it often.	[garbage], No, I didn't. You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?	Oh, maybe a little. Nothing serious.	He let him kiss you. You said you did.	Well, what of it.	Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.	Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	I'm getting very bored with this conversation.	Me, too, bored stiff.	Do you want some brandy?	No thanks.	I think I'll have a little.	It's becoming a habit with you.	Don't be stupid.	Amanda, really.	Nothing. Are you going out somewhere, darling?	Just making myself fascinating for you.	Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.	No, it isn't.	No, it it is not, be quiet.	It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!	They sting.	They snap.	So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	Yes, I did quite a lot.	You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?	I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable. You never had much anyway.	You're quite insufferable. I do imagine it's because you're drunk.	I am not the slightest bit drunk.	You always had a weak head.	I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening. A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.	Oh, really? How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?	Not- Would you shut up.	You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this. You know intemperate tots.	You're not very funny, dear. You better have some more brandy.	You know what? That's a very good idea. I think I will.	You better turn that off, I think.	Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.	Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	I do I shall do no such thing.	Very well. If you have to be boorish and idiotic.	Turn it off. It's driving me mad.	You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.	Turn it off!	Go away! Go away! I- I hate you.	Very amusing indeed.	You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you. You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.	Ja! Very funny.	Stop. Would you just go away? I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.	You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast. And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.	This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.	Oh, you're not going like this.	Yes, I am. Let go with me	[GARBAGE] No, you're not.	You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you. I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again. Oh my God, never!	oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.	Beast	You're a wicked little vampire. And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.

Here I'll just fill it out right here.	No, no, no, because there are other people in line. You have to go get a complete new application.	This will take like a minute, okay? Jesus.

What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.	This is great, isn't it? Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.	I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.	How you doing?	Is that--no--is that just foam? I can't even tell.	Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right? Probably be unmistakable don't you think?	How you doing? Aw, you know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. Oh, how could I be so stupid? I should've brought my flashlight.	What flashlight?	Oh, well sure.	Right, of course. Our flashlight. Mine and yours. I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.	I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?	Yeah.	You cold? Do you want my jacket? Oh, we should've brought the blanket. Our blanket.	This is great, isn't it? A six pack would be just the ticket right now.	I can't believe I forgot. I'm like a kid. It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.	You think they can hear us talk? Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?	Do you want my jacket?	It's after eleven, let's just go home.	Right.	That's my point too.	No. No. That's not my point. The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?	Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away. It's too good to pass up.	Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away. And then they die.	Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives. All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating. I mean,	this is a big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.	What are you so excited about? I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here. It's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.	Yeah they do.	Ah, Augie.	Alright. But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.	I'm just not.	I don't get it. The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.	Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.	We weren't in a good spot.	We didn't see them the first time either.	There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?	Oh man, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.	all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming. And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.	It's like single mindedness with no mind. It's urgency that's pure urge. They don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a question or give it a name.	They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.	Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps. Look, all my hairs are popped up.	Well, so what do you think?	About what?	What I was saying.	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	5	5	0	1	0	0	0	5	1	5	5	1	1	1	5	1	0	1	0	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	0	0
Oh, um-	What's wrong?	You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.	No, no, no, no, no, no. The lady over there, she told me to fill out the front and she said to wait in this line.	Who?	I don't know. Some lady. Sonya or something.	She- she probably doesn't even work here.	Excuse me? No, no. I waited in the line over there..	All right Uh-	and she told me to come over here and she said to fill out everything on the application and I did that.	It's not right.	Look, I-- No, no, no, I--you don't understand. I have to go back to work.	You just take--all right.	Well, you didn't fill this paper at work out right and it's going to take another fifteen minutes to do it and look at how long the line we got here so just-	I am not-	okay, just go back and fill it out real quick and I'm sorry, you have to get back in line and wait. I can't let you cut.	But you don't understand. I cannot get back in line because I have to go back to work. I will get fired if I don't leave here.	[LAUGHTER]	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1

Are you going to get a house or-	I don't want a house, I mean just-	L.A. apartment is fine.	Two artists, though. We're bound to be poor forever.	yeah.	yeah.	Definitely not for a while	yeah.

It's going to be at least six months, probably a year. I tried.	I don't understand why they would just do something like this?	I know, I know. It's really, really messed up.	It doesn't make any sense. It's stupid. I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.	I don't know I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know how to-	Well, maybe you should move in with my mom and she can help.	I don't know, I'm just--I'm trying to think of something.	You can't what?	I don't think there's anything we can do.

Thank you for calling Sprint. We care about everybody. How can I help you?	Hi. I've been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed. I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didn't make.	Are you sure you didn't make them?	I'm positive. They came from like another state.	Can I get your phone number, please?	Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times.	I'm going to need it again. I need to look at your file. If you want me to look at your file--	Okay. three two three six nine seven five zero six six. Can we move on?	Okay.	Umm, Miss Aruckman	I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.	Yes, and I've been through all of the menus, pushed one and star and pound and all of that stuff and I'm just trying to get through to a person who can	Well I'm looking at these.	take off the charges that came from like Nebraska or wherever because, obviously, I didn't make those.	So can you please refund the mischarged charges	So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.	I did not make the calls from B.F.E. Nebraska.	Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um--	So could you discretion it back?	All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.	Okay, but that's like half	What I can	of the money that I was charged that I didn't make those calls.	What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form	which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer-- or Sprint.	Okay, no, look, I- I- I- I'm really -- I'm trying to be patient. I know this isn't your fault. I know that you didn't do it	but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do.	Ma'am, I understand that.	Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things.	Excuse me?	And then then you'll get some money back.	How long does that take?	A few weeks. You won't even know that they were there.	I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend?	Okay. You know what? I just don't feel like doing this anymore. Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now.	Yeah. That's fine. I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me. I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.	You're just going to put it back on my account.	I mean, technically, that's policy. But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.	Sure.	Oh, my God, thank you so much.	You're welcome.	I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously M: Of course, of course.	No, no, no, it's cool. It's cool. It's cool. So, um	make my life a lot easier.	You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later? Or um	Oh, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live? Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see. Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama.	God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever	if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um.	I'll	call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool	Alright. Take Care.

Hey, how you doing?	I'm sorry.	Thanks.	I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--	I know. I just -- I don't know. It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,	a major part of your life and then they're gone. And I don't know. That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.	I'm sorry. It's never easy.	Yeah.	But, I'm here if there's anything you need. I mean, you just have to ask. I know --	Thanks.	--it doesn't really do anything. But--	I just -- it's just not fair.	I know. It never is.	How's, um -- how's his parents doing?	I mean, they're, you know, they're upset. It's like you know, they	feel the same way everybody else does. F: Yeah.	I mean, what do you want to do? Do you want to- do you want to talk about it? Do you-	[BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about. He's gone and I'll never see him again.	Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him. I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.	Yeah.	I mean, we can be grateful for that.	Yeah, I don't know. Sometimes I wish I didn't know him. So I wouldn't--	You feel that way now because you're upset. But you don't really think that.	It'll get better. I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those. M: Mmhmm.	This is just -- this is a terrible life. I just don't understand.	I mean, it's just not fair. Like, I don't know. Why people -	there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.	I agree. If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.	I don't know what to do.	When's the service? Can- can we help? Is there anything, I mean--	I mean, you- you can go. I don't know. I don't know what else.	I hope it rains. Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.	Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.	Yeah.	I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.	I know.	Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.	I don't have any magic answers. But,	I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.	I know.	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3

Well, so what do you think?	It's PR. Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.	Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. You always ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.	Well then what's bugging you?	We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.	There's nothing to it. We come down here. The grunions arrive. They do their little fish business. We go oh, ah look at the fish. They go home. We go home.	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Why not?	We totally skipped. Right.	For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.	Why not?	We never do. Do we have we ever?	We've missed them twice that's not ever.	Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.	We'll see them this year.	and the fish won't show up.	I thought you wanted to see it.	You don't understand anything I'm saying.	No, of course not.	I did want to see it. I always do. I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.	It's just a fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.	I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse. You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem.	We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses. You asked me to dance. So we took off our shoes	and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me	right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking this is it. At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.	Wait a minute. I've got it.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	It was in the car right. Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that. Right?	That's it, right? You want this to be like the other time, right. That's it.	I would rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.	No.	You want me to get some champagne?	No.	No. No.	Well what? Want me to breath in your ear?	No.	Want to get married again?	No.	What? What do you want a divorce?	No.	A vacation?	No.	A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact. What? What? Carla what the hell do you want?	Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.	Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.	No, no I'm just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our	Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us. Because you know what you get,	This what, what is this? This isn't even anything.	Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach. This is waiting. This is fighting.	I'm doing the best I can.	I know you are, Augie. Really I do. I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.	I didn't say that.	No, I know but still. I know I don't make you happy.	For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.	Well don't be ridiculous. Don't you know that? You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else	somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.	Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.	I don't know. It seemed like a good spot to me.	Yeah, I noticed that. Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.	Well look at what we got here.	Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.	It's not champagne.	Well then I guess we don't need glasses.	I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all. Augie I'm sorry.	0	4	4	1	4	1	4	1	0	4	1	4	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	3	3	3	0	3	0	5	3	0	0	3	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	1	3	3	1	3	1	1	3	0	0	2	5	2	0	2	2
Well, what of it?	No, thank you.	I'll have a little, I think.	I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.	Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.	Really, Amanda.	Don't be stupid, what?	Nothing.	Are you going out somewhere dear?	Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?	You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.	You know what? You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.	Nonsense. They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.	They sting. M: They snap.	I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	Yes, I did quite a lot.	I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.	Oh, mind you own business.	I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh? No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.	You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.	I am not in the least bit drunk.	You always had a weak head.	I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long. A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.	On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	Oh very, very interesting Amanda. How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know? Intemperate tots.	Shut up.	Not very funny darling. Why don't you have some more brandy?	That's a very good idea I think I will.	Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.	Why?	Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.	They are away in Tunis.	This is no time a year for Tunis.	Turn it on again, please.	I will do no such thing.	Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	Turn it off. It's driving me mad.	I won't.	Turn it off.	Stop it. No. Go away.	Amanda listen. Listen.	listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.	That's very amusing indeed.	Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible.	You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.	This is the end do you hear me? Finally and forever.	You're not going like this.	Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast.	No you're not.	Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.	0	0	0	4	0	1	4	1	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.	Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.	You let him kiss you. You said so.	What about me?	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	Well, it's true.	Are you bored with this conversation?	So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?	I'll have a little, I think.	No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.	It's become a habit with you.	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.	Don't be so stupid.	Really, Amanda.	What?	Nothing.	Going somewhere, dear?	It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?	No, it isn't.	Yes, it is.	Adders don't snap, they sting.	They sting.	They snap.	I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.	did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?	Mind your business.	You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.	You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.	I'm not in the least bit drunk.	You've always had a weak head.	Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.	Do shut up. Shut up.	I don't want to talk about this anymore.	Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	Turn it on.	Turn it off.	I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.	Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-	Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.	Very amusing indeed.	Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.	You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.	This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.	No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.	Oh, yes I am.	Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.	Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.	I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.	Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	1	1	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	1	4	1	1	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
Why did he invite her?	Why does that bother you?	It's been three years. Why all of a sudden?	Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	How do you know he's even thinking about it?	What's going on here, Joe?	Listen kid.	No, line.	Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe	She's not his girl, Joe. She knows she's not.	You can't read her mind.	Then why is she still single? New York is full of men. Why hasn't she married?	Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.	How do you know why she waited?	Because she knows what I know that's why. She's faithful as a rock.	In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	Look it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe. Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.	What do you want me to do?	But Kate-	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.	She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces. Look, look at it. Joe-	Calm yourself.	Believe with me, Joe. I can't stand alone.	Calm yourself.	Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry. You read it yourself.	Alright. Alright. Calm yourself.	You above all have got to believe. You.	Why me above all?	Just don't stop believing.	What does that mean, me above all? Look at you. You're shaking.	I can't help it.	What have I got to hide?

Alright, so you're not going to believe this. But I went home today. I looked through the mail. And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C.. F: Uh, huh.	I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah.	Yeah, yeah.	I didn't even	know you applied to U.S.C..	I did. I did. I've -- yeah, I applied to U.S.C.. I mean, it's really expensive but	it's a really good school. So	That's amazing. I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow. I mean, well what are you going to major in? What are you going to do? M: Yeah. Yeah.	Yeah. I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present.	Right.	Yeah.	Yes.	And, uh-	Is U.S.C. known for its history program?	Um, you know, I don't think so. But I think that, you know, it's still a private school	and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean-	I know. It's a great school and you know	I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out. And, like, they have a decent history program.	It's all about the connections	So -- and like the geology just is awesome. It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER]	Oh, you did not just say that.	Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school	I know. You're going to be so close.	And, uh, it's just really exciting. I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome	I'm glad you did.	That's great. I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere. You'll still be here.	Everything in LA is twenty minutes away.	Give or take. [LAUGHTER] M: whatever	Well congratulations.	umm, and I'm going to check out school and get, you know, check out the courses	find out all this stuff. And- and I don't know. I think I'm going to try to live in a dorm.	Yeah.	Ouch. That's, um -- oh, wow.	But, congrats on the U.S.C. thing.	No, no, I mean, I didn't know -- I didn't know that about you. Um, I feel like --	The -- what, the- I mean-- F: It's not a big deal.	I'll go to basketball games.	Okay. Well that's cool, too, but like--	Maybe some golf matches.	Wow, you are a winner and a half. [LAUGHTER]	I don't know. Do they have golf? Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.	No, I'm not going to go to a football game.	Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way. M: No way.	I do -- I will need to get a gun-	Okay. Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean	Excuse me?	I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife	No.	'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus M: Yeah, but-	Well I need to defend myself from	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	5	2	5	2	5	2	2	5	2	5	2	2	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And Uh- Yeah. Uh- They're going to need um- more nurses on call for uh- to go overseas to help out with the war.	yeah.	It's going- It's going to be probably in about three weeks.	yeah	God, we're supposed to take a look at a house next week.	Maybe we can still do that	I can't- No, I can't do this alone.	Yeah, and uh--	I know, but look, I have to take this. I mean, if I don't, I mean, I could get fired.	And we know you need-we need the money. We couldn't even- purchase a house if I didn't take this.	God.	You know what happened to my cousin. She went and she never came back.	Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that.	But it- it is for a year.	Oh	Babe, I'm sorry. But I don't want to do.	I can't-	You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.	But you're so good with her. You know, she knows you better than she knows me 'cause I'm at work every day.	I have to work.	[BREATHING]	Babe, I love you.	You can't leave your daughter alone like this.	But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man.	It's going to be okay.	You can't postpone it?	No, I have to go.	Wait, you can write me and as you know, send me pictures.	I don't know if I can handle you going another year.	What do you mean?	I don't know if I- if I could take it.	Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--	I can't be that strong. A whole year.	me, oh my god.	What if you don't come back?	and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--	I will come back.	It doesn't look very good.	we'll have all the money that we ever needed.	And- And then I'll stop working and- I'll stay home with the baby.	I don't want the money. I want-you here	If your life is going to be in danger and this family is going to be in danger we don't need the job. We'll find the money.	It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.	How are we supposed to tell Amy? How's she supposed to understand that?	Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while.	How is she going to feel the first year in school, no mom.	Don't do that to me.	It's hard enough already, Brian, I can't.	I know.	I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this.

What's he going to say?	He saw it.	He was out here when it broke.	Four o clock this morning. I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right over there when it cracked.	I don't know.	He's dreaming of him again, walking around.	I guess he is.	I don't know the meaning of it. But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father.	You know Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	What do you want to do? Argue with him?	I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.	You know? Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him? Do we contradict him? Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore? That we haven't had any hope for years now?	You can't say that to him.	We've got to say it to him.	Where's the proof? Do you have any proof?	For God's sake, three years? Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.	To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face. But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?	Sit down, Mom. I want to talk to you.	All right, all right, all right. You know why I asked Annie here, right?	Why?	You know.	Well I got an idea, but what's your story?	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	You know it's not just my business.	So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?	Then it's not just my business.	You know sometimes you infuriate me. you know that? Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it? God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	She's not Larry's girl. F: Line. M: From mother's point of view, he's not dead.	From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive. The girl is Larry's girl. F: From...line. M: Now you can go on from here.	Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.	I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time. F: You're --	You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.	To hell with that.	I just don't see why. Have you asked Annie yet?	I wanted to get this settled first.	Well how do you know she's going to marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.	Well if she does, then that's it. That's the end of it. From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.	And then we'll thrash it out with father. Okay Mom? Don't avoid me.	The trouble is you don't see enough women. You never did.	So what. I'm not fast with women.	Why does it have to be Annie?	Because it is.	Oh that's a great reason. It's no reason at all.	I don't know.	You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.	I can't help it, I know her best. I was brought up next door to her, you know? These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.	Mom, what do you want? A diagram?	I don't want a diagram.	He thinks he's coming back Chris.	You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...	...and then what's that going to do to your father? Do you know? I don't.	All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]	Just give it some more thought.	I've given it three years of thought. And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.	But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.	What the hell is this?	I'll get out. I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.	I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.	You have a business here. What the hell is this?	The business? The business doesn't inspire me.	Oh. Must you be inspired?	Yes. I like it for an hour a day. I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.	I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that. Now it's just where to find it.	You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?	On this, I would.	Well you don't want to think like that.	Then help me stay here.	All right. But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris? It's all for you. This whole shooting match is for you.	I know that. Then just help me stay here.	Just don't think like that.	Well I am thinking like that.	I don't understand you, do I?	No. You don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	I can see that.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	4	0	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	0	1	0	4	1	4	1	1	1	1
Hey, what's up?	Guess what came today?	What?	My acceptance letter.	From U.S.C..	Yes, I am.	Well yeah, that's the general idea. [LAUGHTER]	That's awesome. Congratulations.	Big bad acceptance packet with all the information. I'm going to U.S.C..	That's amazing. Wow.	I know. [LAUGHTER]	[LAUGHTER] Yeah, uh. No.	[LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.	The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.	I know but you should get like a taser or something. I mean walking around the campus at night-	Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?	There we go. Perfect. M: That'll work.	And a taser. Excellent. Just make sure it's a big knife.	I don't want any of those little puny ones.	So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?	Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving.	U.S.C. has a major in that, right.	They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.	they have that as a major?	That's ridiculous. I don't believe that.	Okay. Well I'm lying but-	Seriously, what's your major?	Well, I haven't decided yet. I want to try some things out.	So you're undecided?	Hey, that's cool.	No, no. It's totally cool. I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life.	okay. Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER]	Uh, well-	And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.	You- you- you'll find.	So this works out perfectly. Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then- M: yeah, sweet.	You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.	Everything worked out perfectly.	That's awesome.	I know. We should have a party.	An I got accepted to U.S.C. party.	No. An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. [LAUGHTER]	Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right.	A party celebrating your acceptance.	Right. Now you're with me.	That's cool.	That is why I got accepted.	Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm	I know. M: So, um	I don't know are you, like, I don't know. Are you, like, available or anything?	Well I mean I don't know. It's like you know I kind of had a crush on you throughout high school and, like	I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know. It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway. I don't see what the problem is.	What- what did you have in mind?	Movies- movie, we'll go to a movie and a dinner and- and	actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you- it's Red Lobster. It's like down on	[LAUGHTER]	Vermont.	Wait, you've been there before?	On occasion I've heard of it.	Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome.	Yeah. Totally.	Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing.	I am totally down with the ice cream.	Okay. Putt-putt golfing?	Eh, we can work that part out.	Yeah, you want to go. No, you want to go. You want to go.	Alright.	I can see it in your eyes. You want to go.	party.	Good. Alright we're so happy.	That's right. Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school.	I know.	Are you going to take out loans or-	Okay well that's not a happy part. We don't want to talk about that.	Well no. I mean I have some scholarships and some financial aid and stuff but I'll have to, you know, I'll get a job	while I'm in school. It'll be good.	Yeah. It will work out. Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.	I know. Right down the street.	But, um-	I mean, like, I don't know. I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash. You can, you know	Or library.	I just said the library	or, um, campus cruiser. You can drive people around.	Excellent. Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for.	Right or you can run for student counsel.	Okay. No, that's dorky.	Dorky?	Yeah.	It's important.	Student counsel?	No, it's dorky.	Fine. It's dorky.	Social life. Hello.	But that'll fit you because you're a dork.	[LAUGHTER].	[LAUGHTER].	I dork.	No. But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something. I don't really want to do the sorority thing. I'm not really feeling that vibe with the	Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by	lots of drunk frat boys	Yeah.	What have you heard about the Greek system?	I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.	Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?	I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-	Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad. I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go. You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college. M: That's right.	No, no, no. You're right though. I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people. I know that I was in an apartment off campus	that happened, you know, that was going on. F: about living in a dorm.	That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER]	me.	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	0	0	5	0	5	0	0	0	5	0	5	0	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	0	0	5	0	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	5	0	5	0	5	5	0	5	0	5	5	5	5	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	5	0	0	5	5

She--,well, she said yes, first of all, let me say that right off the bat. Well, I would like to assume, too. But you never know these things, right?	Okay good. I I assumed.	oh-	I did it up at Yosemite. We went camping right like we usually do. You know we go camping up there all the time. But, um- the waterfalls had died down a little bit, you know. And so uh- we-I had her climb up.	You know- we did some- you know some rock climbing up the waterfalls and went up to this little pool that was up there. And then, I- it's great. Um- You have to climb this little rock-	uh-huh	and you can climb it and it's covered in algae you know. So, I wanted her to climb it to go take a picture, like, back in this little waterfall area, and she got back there and she took her picture. And then, I had her come back. And I was going to do the same thing.	Well, instead I climb up on the rock and like I- I didn't do it -- well, I did it on purpose. I made it look like I accidentally did it. I slipped down into this pool of water, right? And she freaks out because I slide all the way down this rock. And um-	And I pop up out of the water -- and I had planned it already, you know? I pop up out of the water and I [BREATHING] and I like, grab her hand, you know. and that In my hand, I've got the ring.	And she's like- she feels it you know and she doesn't know what it is. And she you know helps me get out and I won't let go of her hand. And she's like, what are you doing? I and said, You saved my life, now will you marry me?	Oh, my God. That's so dramatic.	Wasn't that great? I didn't want it to be too hokey.but- but- She liked it.She liked it.	so cute.	No, it's totally original, though.	oh.	Yeah. And she said yes. And she cried, of course.	Oh, Then you had a whole weekend of camping?	Yes. We did that in the beginning, exactly. So we had, so we just had, you know, good times the rest of the weekend, yeah.	Oh, right. sure [LAUGHTER]	It was a lot of fun- It was a lot of fun. She's great. And I'm so happy.	So where are you going to have your wedding?

Can I help you?	Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form. You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..	Right, but this is the wrong form. Somebody gave you the wrong form.	Yeah. So, I can't -- I can't do anything-	No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --	What's the difference? What's the difference between that form and this form?	Sir, don't get an attitude with me.	I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.	No, I understand and there are a lot of people here. But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.	Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?	I don't know. I don't know who told you. It wasn't me.	Well, it was this girl standing right next to you. Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?	You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.	I know.	Sir, you- I mean	Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?	You can waist as much as you want	Yeah. I know it's gonna take a minute. But you-- so you might as well get started now.	Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.	I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.	Why can't we just -- you know what? How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?	Sir, please don't waste my time.	There is nothing I can do about it. You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.	Come on! You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule? I know that you guys make exceptions. I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?	They're different forms, we process them all different-	Wouldn't you? Oh, come on. you just tell me. You would make an exception for me.	I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.	Sir, don't patronize me. I can't make an exception. I don't- I don't have the power to do that. It's a different form.	Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.	They're processed differently.	That's crap- You're crap. I don't buy it.	Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.	I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D. That's as simple as it is. I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.	I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.	Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.	That's just dumb.	But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.	I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!	Well, that's unfortunate, sir. You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.	This is crap. You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state. Screw California. I'm out of here.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	4	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	4	1
Hey, what time is it? This pokes around midnight right? God this is great isn't it?	Look at the night we got. I wouldn't trade this for anything.	You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it. How are you doing?	Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul? I can't even tell.	But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it? Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think? How are you doing?	Oh, you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid? I should've brought my flashlight.	Yes.	God. Oh, you know what would be good right about now? A six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket.	I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack. God, I'm like a little kid. It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]	I wonder if they can hear us talk? Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?	Do you want my jacket?	It's past eleven, let's go.	There is no point in coming down here.	That's my point.	That's my point too...No. No. That's not my point. My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. It only happens once a year. I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.	Pass up what? These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die.	Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.	But this is the big night for these guys. Their last, life's last orgy.	Yeah they do.	Augie.	Okay. But it's fish that do something that no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.	I'm just not.	You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions.	You didn't see them the first time either.	We just weren't in the good spot. This is a much better spot. You know, I have a good instincts for these things.	Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?	You know, this is great isn't it? You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.	I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.	Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...	...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way. They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything. No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.	It's single mindedness with no mind. It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.	They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.	Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps. Look, all my hairs are standing up.	[BREATHING] So what do you think?	About what I just said?	It certainly is not. It's	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	0	1	1	1	1	5	1	5	5	5	1	5	0	1	1	1	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	1

See look initialed. All done. Ready to go.	Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now. I have other people waiting in line right now.	I have been waiting for over an hour.

She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to. I have kids to pick up from school. I can't just stay here.	like I said before right now.	This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.	Ma'am you are testing my patience. Do you understand me?	You're testing my goddamn patience.	I'm testing your patience?	I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?	I don't need to be. I need to go and do other things with my time. Okay.	Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here. Please.	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	4	1	4	4	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4
Hi. Um- My luggage didn't come out of the conveyor thingy.	Hmm. Hmm.	So, um, what do I do?	How long ago was that?	Uh- Like, an hour and a half ago. I talked to somebody who was standing out there and they said wait. Sometimes like random butt- pieces come out late.	Uh-Hmm.	And so I waited there, but nothing came.	Um, okay. Well, you can fly- file a claim. Where were you coming from?	I was coming from um the Midwest, like Iowa.	So, within the country, though? umm	Yeah, I know I was in the country. I mean, it's not that complicated.	Yeah, well the chances of it being lost forever, you know, are slight because -- -- you were in the --	Well, I would hope so.	Well, I mean, you know that happens pretty often that sometimes baggage -- -- gets lost.	People lose --	yeah.	You know, this is actually, I mean it's -- it's a really important piece of luggage.	Okay.	I mean, it's not big or anything like that. I mean, it's not worth a lot of money or anything.	Did you have insurance on your flight?	No, you have to buy it now. It's like thirty dollar extra.	Well, no one even told me about that. Like, why would I think to buy insurance? I was- It's like a three hour flight.	well, it's something that worth	yeah, I don't know.	How can you lose my luggage like from like, in --	Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane.	I should hope so. You know, I need that today.	Um, well, there's not much I can do. I can, you can file this report and we'll call you when it comes in.	Let me explain to you what the problem is. My grandfather's remains are in that bag. And I have to, like, distribute them today. We're suppose to, you know, throw them out to the sea today.	wow.	Wow. Well, that's really important, obviously. But, um --	Yeah. I mean, if you have a suggestion, like, it would be great to help me out here.	Uh- Actually, I don't know that that's legal. Um- it is the issue	Well, I don't care if it's legal. It's happened. It's already done.	Yeah I mean, Your bag might have been confiscated because it's --	Well, could you tell me if it's been confiscated then.	-- it's a biohazard. so- um	I mean, some information here would be great. Some help. Can you, like, type something in and find out?	Yeah. Let me just call security.	That would be great. Thank you very much.	[LAUGHTER] Okay. Hold on.

So, uh, so how's it been going? I mean, you have any needs or anything?	I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end. You know what I mean. People are sick of me calling--	No. You can't think that way. I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't	Yeah, but it--I mean it's the same response you get over and over again. Like--	Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready. F: It's just--	But, it's been so long, like--I mine as well just take a job at McDonald's. Like, I don't--	No, come on. Don't [GARBAGE]	I just--I can't do it anymore. Like, it just takes it out of you--	I know. I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going. I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know. Something is definitely going to come up. I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--	I just keep getting rejected. I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job.	No. It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know. That's-That's what it is. that's what you gotta be is competitive.	Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough. Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that--	There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot...	...dumber than you. I mean they're a lot worse off than you. You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know	I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand.	I know. It makes it harder. I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--	It's just so frustrating. Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore. You know? I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time. You know, it's just like--	But you gotta. Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?	I feel so worthless.	It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off. I know it. I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette. You know, you're a good worker and...	... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon. All right? So you just gotta--	And what would make you say that? There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better.	Because I know you. You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago. You know? but And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta-	It's just really hard. I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me. You know what I mean? Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you. You know?	Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know	Or they'll never talk to me again.	Or, well, no. Okay. you -[GARBAGE]	I-I just I think maybe I should try something else. I mean, I-I don't know. All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't. I'm not physically able apparently. I mean--	That obviously that's not true though. I mean, you've done this before. You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--	I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does. You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but	Right.	Well, you've gotta live.	you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough.	I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--	I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know. Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.	Well, come on, come on. Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	3	0
Can I help you?	Yes, please help me. Where is my bag?	I need a little more information.	Where is my bag? Come on, I've been here for four hours.	What- What flight did you come in on?	Okay, I'm coming in from Atlanta.	Georgia?	There's no need for you to raise your voice, sir.	I've been college educated.	I speak your language.	Are you insinuating that I don't have a college education and that- for some reason that makes you a better person than I am?	Listen, shut your smug mouth, okay? I don't need that.	I'm just saying you don't need to talk to me like I-	I've been sitting here for four hours.	I'm not a child.	You people have just been tossing me around like a used hanky.	You work here.	Details, Details. Well, anyhow can I--	so you flew in from Atlanta...	My bag from Atlanta.	Four...Four hours ago.	It's a little black bag with wheels.	Do you have any i-?	I wouldn't let you? I was not in Atlanta. I was not in Atlanta.	I had nothing to do with the boarding attendance. I'm sorry that your seat was wherever it was.	I have some unfortunate news, uh, that your bag isn't going to be--	--arriving any time soon.	I'm really sorry to tell you this but...	Okay.	It's not. I can offer you fifty dollars and a reimbursement gift cards for our airline...	...and your future...	No.	Yes.	Where is it? Where did it go?	We've actually...	They do as matter of fact. We don't like to publicize it because	people wouldn't Fly our airline.	Probably people that work for your company huh?	Do you know what was in that little bag that I could have just easily put in overhead compartment but no I had to check?	What was that?	My computer which has all of my data which I'm collecting right now.	That's unfortunate.	Yeah it's really unfortunate you know why because I'm going to get fired if I don't get that. So I need to have that back.	That's too bad.	Fifty dollars is not going to cover me for my job, okay?	I wish I could give it to you.	Well you need to find it. Can I just go back there and look through the bags? Can I just go back there and just go through maybe I'll find it.	I wish I-	That's not - no.	No.	It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service. I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.	We have plenty of aggressive searching going on it's not there. Someone's taken it.	Sure, yeah right you have plenty of aggressive searching going on, aggressive searching, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes.	I know what you guys do when you're not working you're union people; you just sit around on your ass.	You know I don't need to take this sort of abuse.

What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.	He saw it.	He was out there when it happened.	About four in the morning. I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened. F: What was he doing--?	I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.	Did you talk to him?	No. I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.	He cried hard?	I could hear it right through the floor.	Starting to dream about him again. He's walking around at night again.	I guess he is.	He's getting just like he did after he died, you know? What, what, what's the meaning of this?	I don't know. But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.	Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.	No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.	Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night. Walk around. Why shouldn't he walk around? Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him? Do we contradict him? Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?	That we haven't had any hope for years now?	How are you going to prove it? Can you prove it?	Larry's been gone for three years. For god sakes no one comes back after three years. It's insane.	he still thinks he's alive still. I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?	Listen mom, just, sit down. I want to talk to you.	No. It's his god damned newspapers is what it is. Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.	Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.	You know why I asked Annie here, right?	Why?	I want to ask her to marry me.	You know it's not just my business.	Well what do you want me to do? I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.	Okay. So then it's alright. I'll go ahead with it.	Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--	Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes. Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit? Huh? God you have such a talent for ignoring things.	Well I'm just saying--	She's not Larry's girl.	From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair. You can't do that.	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back	And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can. But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go. You got it? I mean, do you?	My whole entire, bloody life time and time again.	Well to hell with that.	Did you ask Annie yet?	I wanted to get this settled first.	Then I guess that's the end of it.	But from her letters I think she's forgotten him. I'll find out.	And then we'll thrash it out with dad right? Mom, don't avoid me.	Look, you never had seen many, many women. You know? I mean...	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	It's just...that's just the way it is. That's how I feel. You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie. What do you want a diagram?	No I don't want a diagram.	He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him? I don't know. Do you? I mean, I don't know. M: No.	Alright then.	I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.	But if I can't have that here I'll get out.	I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.	I've been a good son too long. A good sucker and I'm through with it.	You're just going to leave the business? You have a business here. You can't do that.	The business doesn't inspire me.	Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful. I want a family. I want a wife. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.	Now Annie is in the middle of all that. Where do I find it?	Tell me something. You can leave this business?	Yes. On this I would.	Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?	I mean what the hell have we worked for then? I mean, it's all for you Chris. The whole shooting match is for you.	I know. Just you help me stay here.	Alright but you don't talk like that you hear? You don't.	I am thinking like that.	I don't understand you do I?	No you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	Yeah. I can see that.	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	1	3	3	3	1	4	1	4	4	1	1	1	1	4	1	0	4	0	1	4	0	0	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	0	0	0	3	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	0	0	4	4	4	4	1	3	0	1	4	3	1	3	3	3	3
So you're leaving tomorrow.	Yeah. They just called.	This is really-this is unfair.	I know.	I don't see [BREATHING]	I don't know what to say. I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.	I mean we both knew that this was going to happen. It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.	And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.	I'm going to come back. I need you to believe that.	You don't know that.	I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.	Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.	Do you think I want to leave you?	You have a choice.	I have to do this. I don't want to leave. Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?	I know. It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.	You're a smart person. There are other things you can do.	Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on	And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.	I mean I'm the one who has to leave here. I'm the one who has to leave the two of you. At least you get to be together.	What's that supposed to mean?	I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.	Well I'll come back. What is that supposed to mean? You're not willing to wait for me to come back?	Of course I'm going to wait. I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff. I just- I can't-	I can't deal with this emotionally.	What do you want me to do?	I want you to leave. I want you to leave the service.	Well I can't very well do it today. I still have to leave tomorrow.	You can do it today. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.	You're not making this any easier for me, you know. I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.	Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.	I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.	That's all I'm saying... No you don't.	Thanks that helps.	It's just really unfair. This is- this is bullshit.	I feel much better now.	You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.	I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.	Yeah. Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing. Why don't you just get out now and then-	I will but I can't right now.	Then go. We'll be here when you get back. F: That's it?	That's how you want to leave it?	I don't know how else to leave it. What, do you want me to lie to you?	You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?	I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be. I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.	Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go. It just doesn't work that way.	Fine.	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	3	3	1	1	3	3	1	3	1	1	1	3	1	3	3	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	1	4	4	1	4	1	1	4	3	3	3	3	3
I know, it went out of style, didn't it?	It's all right. It's a good thing.	You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.	No, not sorry. But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.	The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so. But they take it for granted that we're all set.	I knew they would, your mother anyway.	Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?	I guess this is why I came.	I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here. I wanted some place we'd never been before. A place where we'd be brand new to each other.	Well, you started to write me	You felt something that far back?	Every day since.	Ann, why didn't you let me know?	Let's drive someplace. I want to be alone with you.	No. Nothing like that.	Well, what's wrong? I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.	Yeah, I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.	It wouldn't work this way.	Well, I lost them.	Just about all.	It takes some time for a guy to toss that off. 'Cause they weren't just men.	For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. I put them in pocket. It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other. I mean that exactly. I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	I got this idea watching 'em go down. Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made. A sort of responsibility. Man for man. You know what I mean?	To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	Then I came back and it was incredible. There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident. I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all. It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys. I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man. You've gotta be a little better because of it.	Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it. And I didn't want to take any of that. And I guess that included you.	Do you still feel that way?	I want you now Annie.	'Cause you mustn't feel that way. Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris. Everything, you understand that? Me too.	I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money. I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air. A man should be paid for that.	What'll I do with a fortune?	2	2	2	2	1	2	0	2	5	2	5	2	5	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	0	3	3	2
What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	When? I was the first one up. He was still in bed. How could he have seen it?	Did you talk to him?	No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.	He cried hard?	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it. So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	What do you want to do, argue with him?	I don't want to argue with him. But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.	Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night? Do we contradict him? Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	We have to say it to him.	how are you gonna prove it? Can you prove it?	For Gods sake! Three years! Nobody comes back after three years. That's insane!	To you it is and to me, but not to him. Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave. So where are you?	The trouble is the God damn newspapers. I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.	All right. All right, mom. Just listen. You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	It's not just my business.	Well, what do you want me to do? You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.	So it's okay then? I should just go ahead and do it?	Oh, so it isn't just my business?	I'm just saying.	You infuriate me sometimes. Do you know that? God.	Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	I ignore what I got to ignore. I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	She is not Larry's girl!	From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl. Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know. So what can I do for you?	I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else. My whole bloody life; time after time after time.	Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that	To hell with that!	Have you asked Annie yet?	Well, what if she feels like your father? And how do you know she will marry you?	Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.	So what? I'm not fast with women.	Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	Well, that's a good reason. But that doesn't mean anything at all. I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.	I know her best, all right? I don't know. I grew up next to her. When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?	No. I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris. You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead. Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know? Because, I don't.	I've given it three years of thought. I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now. And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.	But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.	I'll get out. I'll go get married and live someplace else. I don't know, maybe New York.	Are you crazy?	I have been a good son for too long. A good sucker. I'm through with it.	Yes. On this, I would.	Well, you help me stay here.	All right. But don't think like that. Because what the hell did we work for, Chris? I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.	I know that, mom. Just, you help me stay here.	Just don't think that way. Do you hear me?	I don't understand you, do I?	No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	Yeah, I can see that.	3	3	3	3	3	1	1	1	4	1	1	4	1	4	1	0	0	1	4	1	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	1	0	4	0	0	0	4	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	1	1	1
Hey, a what's up?	Um, Johnny died yesterday.	Wow, that's horrible.	I'm sorry to hear about that.	We knew that it was coming, but--	Yeah.	It seemed like he had a little bit longer. Like just last week, he was doing was so well.	I mean, you know, at least he's not in anymore pain now, right?	Yeah.	It's good, you know. you know It hurts I know. I know what it's like to lose someone like that.	I just don't want him to be gone.	It's okay.	'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on.	I mean--I don't know.	And his whole family was there.	I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know	Well, that's that's good, you know. At least, I don't know. I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than...	.than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process. I mean--	He was so young, you know. And all the stories he used to tell me about...	...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna--	But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead. I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and--	Nobody's ever gonna forget him.	Yeah, exactly. He's made a big impact on a lot of people. and	And you'll always have that and--you should feel, you know, happy for him that he got to do so much before--I mean, and even after he found out last year. I mean--	He did a lot. But--	I know. It doesn't bring him back, but--	But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and--	I'm gonna forget him.	No, you'll never forget him.	I won't be able to hear his voice or his--	I know. but you're not I mean you're not going to forget him. The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside--	You start to lose like that image after a while.	That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell. Time heals, you know, and it's good. It's okay. I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so .	It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now.

Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.	That's the wind.	Well, so, what do you think?	About what?	About what I was saying.	Not just me, look at all of these people.	Carla, can I ask you something? Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?	Don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that. It's insulting.	Well then, what's bugging you?	We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.	There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing. We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.	For God- Grow up, Augie. The fish are not going to arrive.	Why not?	Because they never do. Have they...Have they ever?	We've missed them twice.	Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.	They'll show up this time.	I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up. And the fish never show up.	You don't understand anything I am saying.	No. Of course not.	I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting. I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.	For God's sake, this is not about fish.	Okay. I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.	Okay. So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay. And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go? And I said, sure great, let's go.	Okay. So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.	Do you remember the first year we came here? It was like four years after we got married.	You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them. And I remember thinking, this is it. You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.	It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne. I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.	dancing barefoot in the sand.	That's what it is? Right? You want this to be like the other time, right?	I'd rather not remember some things. I'd rather not hope for some things.	Sure. All right. Okay.	Listen, do you want to dance?	No.	Do you want me to go get some champagne?	Do you want to take off your shoes?	No, no. Nothing.	Do you want to get married again?	No.	No.	[BREATHING]	No I'm just like you. I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves. And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children. Huh, baby, the joke's on us. Because you know what you get?	Do you know what you get? You get this.	This? What is this? This is nothing. This isn't even anything.	Yes it is.	I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just...	[BREATHING]	Do you understand what I am saying?	I'm doing the best I can.	I know you are Augie, I know.	I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.	Maybe if you were with someone else, too.	I didn't say that.	I just- I know I don't make you happy.	You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else. Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.	You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.	So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.	I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me.	We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?	Hmm. I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.	[BREATHING]	And look what I got here.	Augie, you bought refreshments.	I guess we don't need glasses.	[BREATHING]	Do you want to go home? Are you cold?	I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.	Augie, I'm sorry.	Shh. If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	Or not.	Or not.	5	0	5	0	0	1	0	4	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	3	1	4	1	0	0	0	2	0	1	1	3	0	0	0	0	2	1	2	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	3	3	3	3	3	3	0	0	1	0	2	0	2	2	2	2	0	2	3	0	0	2
Why does that bother you?	She's been in New York three and a half years. Why all of the sudden?	Well maybe. Maybe she just wanted to see her again.	What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	How do you know he is even thinking about it?	Well, so what.	What's going on here, Joe?	Now, listen, Kate, just-	She's not his girl. She knows she's not.	She's . . . Then why is she still single. New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.	How do you know why she's waited?	Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	Look. It's a nice day. Why are we arguing?	Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith. Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.	What do you want me to do? What do you want--	I want you to pretend like he's coming back!	But, Kate...	Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.	[LAUGHTER]	Laugh. Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?	Calm yourself.	Calm yourself!	Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.	All right, all right. Calm yourself.	You've got to believe. You've got to--	What do you mean me above all? Look at you. You're shaking!	I can't help it!	What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	1	1	4	1	3	4	4	4
I just got some bad news.	My friend, Shotty, passed away.	Oh, I'm so sorry	The end, he's been sick for awhile. He had cancer.	Oh, my gosh.	Yeah. It's just, I never thought it would actually happen, you know? I mean- He's such a fighter and he's always so positive about everything.	You know, he was gonna, and we -- all the way up to the end we were just talking about how- you know all the stuff we were gonna do and, you know. When he finally kicked this stupid cancer, you know, and we were gonna --	he wanted to travel, you know. And he's so talented. Probably the most talented person I have ever met in my entire life.	What did he do?	He was a designer, you know. But he did everything. You know, He painted and he- and he did costume design, he did set design, he did lighting, he was --	he just did everything. He was literally, literally the most talented guy I have ever met in my entire life.	And he's gone now and I -- I just can't believe it.	Yeah. I'm so sorry.	I mean, one second you think, you know, you're just having a conversation and then --	you know, sometimes you think you want to make that phone call, or you think you want to tell somebody something, or something like that. Do you know what I mean? Like that's -- he was the person that I did that with. You know, like, that's the person who I needed to call to tell things to all the time.	You guys have been-	And now I don't have that person anymore, you know. And it's -- -- it's just, you.	You think that things get easier, you know, as you as you get older and you -	and it just gets worse. It just gets worse, everything is bad all the time; people die, your friends die, family dies, your best friends die. it's-	I'm sorry. I-	You always think, you know when you were- you know when you were a little kid and you think something is gonna happen, like, it will all be better when I am older, you know?	Wow, Ryan I know that you are hurting right now but I don't think you always feel like that.	No, you're right. I don't. You're right.	Even, yeah -- he doesn't he would never feel that way, he would never want me to feel that way. Of course not, but that's just where I am right now and -- -- I don't know what else to do with it.	Yeah. I understand. I think it's really healthy to grieve.	I just miss him.	If there's anything I can do to be there for you.	Thanks.	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3
Yes. The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.	Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.	Presents? A trivial little broach.	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	No I didn't. You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.	You must admit he was in love with you.	Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.	You let him kiss you. You said so. What of it?	Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.	And what about me?	Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.	Yeah, so am I. Bored stiff.	You want some brandy?	I'll have a little I think.	I don't know why you want it. You've already had two glasses.	No particular reason. Anyhow they were very small ones.	I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.	Oh my...just because I just...okay...	It's become a habit with you.	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.	Really Amanda.	What?	Nothing.	Going out somewhere dear?	No, just making myself beautiful for you.	That's the woman's job to lure the man. Watch me a moment won't you?	Actually that's perfectly true.	Yes it is.	I think that M: Shh.	Adders don't snap, they sting.	They sting.	They snap.	Mind your business.	You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.	I'm not in the least bit drunk.	You've always had a weak head.	Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy. That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.	On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.	Oh, what an interesting topic. What about a child of four and a child of six? A child of nine?	Shut up.	We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.	Not very funny dear. In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.	Oh, thanks. I think I will.	You better turn that off.	They are away in Tunis.	Turn it on again, please.	No I'll do no such thing.	Very well. If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.	Come on, turn it off. It's driving me mad.	You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.	Turn it--Turn it off.	Go away. Go away. I hate you.	Very amusing indeed.	I hate you. Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.	You know what? You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.	This is the end. Understand? This is the end, here and now, forever and always.	You're not going nowhere. No you're not.	Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.	Just shut up.	shut up. shut up. I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.	Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you. Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you? Marry you? Never. I will never marry you. I will die die in torment-	Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.	Oh.	0	0	4	4	0	4	0	4	0	4	4	4	0	0	4	4	4	4	0	4	1	4	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
So what's up? What's new?	Well Vegas was awesome.	Yeah. I heard.	And, um, I got married.	Yeah. In the old town part.	Who did you marry?	Um- Yes. It was very romantic.	It was at the slot machines.	Uhuh, uhuh. He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.	He turned to you and was like...	[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.	Yeah. Well. You know, because he's leaving the next day.	Yeah.	But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.	Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?	Oh. I hadn't even thought about that.	Yeah. But he'll have like a long visa. Can you go visit then for a long time? M: I think you can.	Oh. Totally. M: Yeah.	I guess I'll- I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER]	Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER]	Is that your phone?	Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now	He loves you.	He likes to keep tabs, you know.	How much did he win at the slot?	Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.	Penny slots. That's what he plays.	Yeah.	I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much. I don't know.	Yeah. We played Wheel of Fortune pennies. It's like a giant thing with like-	But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.	Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.	like, wait, but it's just pennies. You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.	Yeah.	Well so now we're married. We have cat children.	Awesome.	[LAUGHTER] Cat babies.	We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.	That's fair enough.	She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER]	0	2	0	2	2	5	2	2	2	0	2	2	0	2	0	2	0	2	2	2	2	5	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	2	5	2	2	0	2
What time is it? God, this is great, isn't it? I can't believe it.	Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything. Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight? Is that what it is midnight? How you doing, huh? You okay? That's good.	Look, there what's that, what's that? Is it--	Ugh...	Oh, no I can't tell though. Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah. Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?	Gosh, this is great, isn't it? This is awesome. Oh, no you know what I forgot?	Flashlight the silver one. There's only one isn't there?	Oh, well, yeah of course.	You keep saying my flashlight like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel? M: No.	Of course, our flashlight. What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight.	Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.	No.	You know what we should've brought a blanket too. Man, our blanket, our blanket. Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack.	I'm fine.	Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid.	I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even. M: Eek. Hehe. Oops.	I wonder if they can hear me talk F:[Chuckles]	I'm cold.	Do you want my jacket?	It's after eleven, let's go home.	What are you kidding? We just got here. We don't want to turn around and go home now. What's the point coming all the way down here?	There is no point.	Right.	That's my point.	That's my point too.	Then let's go.	No, wait no, no that's not my point. My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home.	Why not?	It's not stupid. It's a natural phenomenon.	People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this. It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.	Pass what up? These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.	I don't know what you're so excited about. This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats.	Yeah, they do.	Oh, Augie.	Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.	It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery. I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.	I'm not.	Yes.	All right.	I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life...	And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.	Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.	We just weren't in a good spot though.	We didn't see them the year before either.	Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay? So just--just think about it all right? Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...	Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...	They don't know why, we don't know why. No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...	They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast. And they just started swimming...	Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies. And they all turned as one...	And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...	It's like urgency that's pure urge you know. It's single-mindedness with no mind.	It's crazy. Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.	5	5	5	1	5	5	0	0	4	0	0	0	5	0	5	5	2	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	4	1	1	1	4	4	1	0	1	5	5	1	4	1	1	1	4	0	4	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5
How's it going? How are you feeling?	I ah--	alright.	Hanging in there?	Yeah.	So sad.	It just feels like I was talking to him yesterday.	Yeah.	You guys were real close huh?	He was my only friend growing up.	no one else would talk to me but he would.	He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding.	I'm so sorry.	Yeah.	You know I was always the one to tell him to be more wild you know?	And he just took it overboard.	What happened? What went wrong?	You know a stupid case of drunk driving it's just...	and the worst part of it is that he was in the car with his girlfriend,	his girlfriend got killed too.	Oh man.	And the car that he hit was his family.	How are they?	The mother and father died--	and the kids are paralyzed in a coma right now.	and just going to the funeral it's-	-do I miss him or do I hate him, you know?	Yeah. Like I mean if you need anyone to talk to or anything I'm here for you okay?	We're all here for you.	I was supposed to see him last summer	then I got busy with work and stuff and three years go by	and then something like this happens you know?	I mean I haven't even talked to him on the phone for the past three months.	He's supposed to be my best friend.	I know.	just things happen in life and you just...there's just no explanation you know? We just don't...	It's so fucked up.	Yeah.	I'm so sorry.	Why is that?	He was studying to be a doctor.	I mean he was...he wanted to help people in poor countries, that is his goal. He didn't care about the money. He just wanted to go and help people.	What the...what am I doing?	Working for corporate America? Wow.	He actually wanted to do something.	Well now you can follow his footsteps, you know? Carry out what he wanted to do.	I can't do that.	Well sure you could.	You should've met him.	He is the greatest...everyone liked him.	Yeah.	I would've loved to.	Now I can't.	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3
You're not sorry you came? M: How'd you know?	from her point of view, why else would I come?	You feel it's wrong here, don't you? This yard, this chair. I want you to be ready for me. I don't want to have to win you away from anything.	I almost got married two years ago.	You started to write me and--	Every day since.	I will never forgive you. Why did you wait all these years? All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.	No. Nothing like that.	Then, what's wrong? I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.	Yeah, I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.	You've gotta tell me.	I don't know how to start.	It wouldn't work this way.	It's all mixed up with so many other things. You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	Yeah, sure.	Well, I lost them.	How many?	Just about all.	Oh, gee.	It takes some time for a guy to toss that off. 'Cause they weren't just men.	For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. I put them in pocket. It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other. I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	I got this idea watching them go down. Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made. A sort of responsibility. Man for man.	You know what I mean? To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	Then I came back and it was incredible. There was no meaning in it here. The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident. I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys. I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man. You've gotta be a little better because of it.	Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it. And I didn't want to take any of it. And I guess that included you.	You still feel that way?	What'll I do with a fortune?	0	3	5	2	2	2	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2
How you doing?	Okay.	Yeah. Wow.	We're all going to miss him.	Mmm hmm. I never knew it was going to be this hard, you know.	It's weird 'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually-	he had cancer, you know?	They thought he got--would get better and he did, and then it just- things turned bad.	Turned around for the worst, you know.	I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man.	He was amazing.	I loved that boy.	We did everything together, you know.	It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone.	He's so young. It seems so--	so wrong in so many ways.	His poor parents. You know, it's their only son.	yeah.	Kind of a whole year. I mean, he suffered with this, this monster, this thing, this disease.	He was in chemo the whole time, right?	And he just got that baseball scholarship.	I know. He was, he had so much going for him.	So handsome, so young, so gifted.	So talented.	Such a sweet person, you know?	How's his parents doing?	Not very good.	Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old. M: Jesus	It's weird, I kind of feel like part of me is gone now, you know?	Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away.	You guys were pretty close, weren't you?	He was like, he was like my brother, you know.	He was my brother.	Just seems so unfair, is the way it is.	You know, he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and-	What was her name?	Kelly. Kelly Uveny.	They talked about getting married and--	Trying to have a baby.	Yeah. But then when he got cancer and it got bad, you know, she just took off and-	so I was there for him.	Some people.	Yeah, but you were there all the hospital days. By his bed-	Yeah. God, I loved that kid.	So nice, so positive.	yeah.	We need more people like him.	Joe, do you think he knew I loved him?	I don't know.	I never told him, I love you, but-	I loved him so much.	I don't know if Benny was smart like that- but-	I'm sure he loved you too. He just didn't know it.	0	3	3	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3

So, I'm going to leave without all my lost property? That's what you want me to do? um	Well sir, if if...what I believe has happened is most of the flight was left--	the luggage was left in Baltimore. Therefore--	Most of the...	Like the luggage, the luggage on the flight.	No actually it was...this is the first time this has ever happened. I don't know what happened--	Are you going to refund us for our luggage, refund us for our tickets for this?	Well, we can give you um- hotel lodging for a night if that--	I'm going to San Diego tomorrow to stay with my family. What do I need hotel lodging for hmmm? Can you tell me that?	For tonight- For tonight sir. Would you need to stay somewhere tonight?	We can do Holiday Inn or...?	Wow. Thank you. Holiday Inn. Wow. Thank...the flight cost five hundred dollars.	Sir I understand that but just--	Okay, so you can put me in Holiday Inn for twenty dollar a night?	Did you have your name tags on the luggage?	Of course I had my name tags on the luggage.	Okay. So if you can just give me your name, your name and your address and your phone number I can contact you as soon as we find out more information.	Soon as you...that's not good enough okay?	Sir, please calm down.	I need you to help me out here. Can you get on the phone and get the luggage over on the fastest flight you can and then maybe I won't get you fired.	If not, I'm going to get your name, I'm going to talk to your boss, whoever...I'm never going to fly...my business is never going to fly Delta again.	What is your business?	I work for IBM.	Okay. Sir? I am sorry to tell you this but this does happen. Uh- This is not uh- really,	I mean, our airline's fault. I don't know what happened, misplaced, something happened but we will get you--	You misplace a lot of, eight pieces of luggage.	Well, the entire flight, sir, the luggage was placed on another plane that never actually left Baltimore.	Uh no I'm not.	Are you kidding me?	Who are you going to fire because of that?	Well we have some people back there that need some firing so, but I would just really appreciate--	Wow. This has never happened before. I've not lost,	in all thousand flights I've been on probably I can't even count how many flights I've been on. This has never happened before.	This is the worst customer service I've ever gotten before.	Okay sir. I'm sorry you can--um-	Okay. Get on the phone and figure out where my luggage is and tell me when it's going to get there alright?	We already have been confirmed that it will be arriving in--uh--in about two days.	And and, in about...	Two days I'll be in San Diego and how's it going to get to me in San Diego? You going to make sure it gets to the San Diego airport?	Uh, we can't--	Can you get it to the San Diego airport? You get someone to drive it to my place alright? Then I get a refund for some...I get a free flight alright? I get free whatever.	Yes sir, Yes.	We can have them direct your luggage to San Diego.	Okay. And you're going to give me what for my inconvenience?	Uh--	Some refreshments in the lobby?	Some peanuts? Wow. That helps a lot.	Thanks you, thank you I don't have my luggage so you gave me a Holiday Inn stay and peanuts. Wow. You know what?	eh- we actually--	I will never do business with Delta again.	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	4	0	0	1	0	4	0	0	4	0	4	0	4	0	4	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	4	4	0	4	4	4	1	4	1	4	1	1	4	0	0	1	0	0	4	4	1	4
Good God.	I wonder.	Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	Behave exquisitely.	With the most perfect poise.	Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.	The whole business is really rather ridiculous.	Meaning exactly that.	What does it all mean? That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth. Dear God, what does it all mean?	Who's they?	All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.	Certainly you must. We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].	Well, what if-what happens when our love-	Who knows?	No, that fire will fade along with our passion.	It all depends on how well we played.	Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?	Yes, yes, with all his might.	No, no it isn't. Death is very laughable. Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.	no, So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers. Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --	enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.	Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.	Charles. That was his name. He did wriggle so beautifully.	Horrible thing, I hate it.	How long did that row last?	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?	Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.	And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	[LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.	Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous	Oh, we were very much younger then.	Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	You knew there was nothing.	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	0	5	0	5	5	0	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	2	5	5	0
As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	What of it?	Well, what about me?	Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.	Me, too. Bored stiff. You want some brandy?	No particular reason. Anyhow they were very small ones.	Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.	Well, it's become a habit with you.	You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.	Don't be so stupid.	What?	Nothing.	A woman's job is to allure the man. Watch me a minute, will you?	No, it isn't.	Yes, it is.	Oh, be quiet.	Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.	Adders don't snap, they sting.	Nonsense. They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	They snap.	I don't care, do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.	Mind your own business.	You're quite insufferable	I expect it's because you're drunk.	I'm not in the least drunk.	As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long. A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.	On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	Oh, very interesting. How about a child of four? A child of six? Or a child of nine?	Shut up.	We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think? Intemperate tots.	Not very funny, dear. You'd better have some more brandy.	Why?	Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.	There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.	There are people downstairs I suppose?	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	Turn it on again, please.	I'll do no such thing.	Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	Turn it off. It's driving me mad.	You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.	Turn it off.	Stop it. Go away. I hate you.	Amanda, listen. listen	Listen? Listen, indeed. I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.	Very amusing, indeed.	I hate you. Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.	This is the end. Finally and forever. Do you hear me? The end.	You're not going like this.	Oh Yes, I am.	You're not.	I am. Let go of me. You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.	Shut up. Shut up.	I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--	I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees	Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.	You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.	0	0	4	4	0	0	0	0	1	0	4	4	4	1	5	1	1	4	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	4	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.	Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?	No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.	It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.	You're not sorry you came?	No. I'm not sorry. It's-	Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER].	Well-	What?	Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.	Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.	I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.	Well, I mean,	Oh, Annie.	from her opinion, why else would I come here?	Annie, I love you.	I love you a great deal.	I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.	Well, I guess that's why I came.	I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.	I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.	I've been ready for a long, long time.	You felt something that far back?	Every day since.	Why didn't you let me know?	Give me a kiss, Annie.	Give me-	I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.	We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.	I kissed you.	Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.	Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.	No. What is it? Is it your mother?	No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.	Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.	Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.	You should tell me.	I don't know where to start.	But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.	You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.	Yeah, sure.	Well, I lost them.	How many?	Just about all.	Geez.	It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.	For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.	I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.	And I, and I thought something watching them go down.	Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?	And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.	And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.	And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.	And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.	Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.	And I didn't want to take any of it.	And I guess that included you.	And you still feel that way?	Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.	Annie,	Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.	What am I going to do with a fortune?	2	2	2	2	0	3	1	0	0	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	3	3	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2
Brian, I need help.	Babe, I don't know what to tell you. Don't give up.	Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home? Are you going to be able to find a job there?	I don't know. I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort. I've been trying.	I wish I had some answers for you, babe. I mean-I don't know what to tell you.	How did you get a job? What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I went to school and I got my degree. And I got a job.	I mean, I just don't--I don't know. If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work? It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job. It's impossible. It's totally discriminatory. You have to know somebody.	Nothing's impossible.	It's not fair.	You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and	That's fine. I'd be willing to start anywhere. I can't get a job.	I	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something. And it would help you get somewhere else.	I still can't live on in six seven and five. It's not possible in Los Angeles. Housing is too expensive.	and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere. It's better than nothing and that's all you have. You have nothing right now.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what? I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Wait, You can move up. There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	This is humiliating.	Well, you know what? Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that. I think that's bullshit.	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	I don't know. I feel like I've tried everything.	Have you? There's got to be something else.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right. Maybe you do have to go someplace else. I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here. I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean. I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go? I mean, like what?	If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.	It's the way it seems to me. You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job. And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-	That's really hard to hear.	But it's true, babe. You've got to be more positive about things. Like- Have some faith in yourself.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.	Well, exactly. Money is not everything.	Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money. I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	You can.	You know I would never let that happen. I wouldn't let that happen.	I just-- I	You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again. You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that. If there's any way I can help you, I will.	But you have to keep trying. You can't give up.	Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying. I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.	And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?	I don't know.	I mean are you going in for interviews?	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	Are you presenting-	charismatic.	putting your best foot forward? or you	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Yeah, I follow up.	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	I mean, anything.	Like- What's your ideal job? What do you want to do?	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	Of course.	But um--	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	Yeah.	So what's the something else?	Bartending, catering.	You can't get a catering gig? Well, I can call some friends. I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	yeah.	Okay. Okay, I'll call some people.	Thank you.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too. Okay?	I will, I will.	You know I'll always help you.	3	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	4	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	3	3	0	3	0	0	3	1	1	0	3	1	3	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
I'm sorry, Joy.	Is there anything I can get you? Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?	...pick up anything?	No.	You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.	That's sweet.	Thank you.	I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.	I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died. I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.	Hmm.	So I was like wandering around before. It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.	So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone. And- F:Umm.	this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.	Oh. She was there?	Yeah. And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.	And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine. She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.	Mmhmm.	I don't know. It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it. I don't know. Whatever.	Yeah.	I don't know.	How long were you there for?	At the cemetery?	Mmhmm.	couple hours.	I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day. We ran through the sprinklers.	Oh really?	You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?	Is it a big cemetery?	Yeah. It's huge. Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.	Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?	Yeah.	It's weird. Whenever I go back to town, I think of her. I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one. And yeah. She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.	My best friend Heather. She's got a- we have a- we built this like little-- There's a park, Prospect Park. And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.	She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.	Mmhmm.	Umm. Yeah.	And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...	But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized. And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head. It was cool.	Mmhmm.	Some, I guess. She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and- F:Mmhmm.	So she wrote a lot of poetry?	There's another one, I can't remember.	I remember, too, when we were-- she died at U.C.L.A. She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back. And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room. All she needs is a God damn audience.

What are you gonna study?	oh, Theater. yeah, yeah.	Really? Are you doing the M.F.A. program?	yes.	oh-	I heard it's so tough to get into.	It's exactly what I wanted.	That's awesome.	I worked really hard, I'll say, I worked really hard. You know, I I'm not bragging or anything like that. But-	Yeah, that's awesome.	No.	Uh huh. Yes, seriously, for years.	Finally. I'm so excited. We're gonna -- well, I'll be here. We're still gonna be able to see each other.	I know. I know. I'm- I'm definitely -- I realize [LAUGHTER].	What are you, wait, what are you doing?	Um- I'm gonna be studying at U.S.C., too.	Perfect! Oh, my God. Are you staying, are you going to live on campus?	Yeah. Totally- Well where are you going to live?	We are gonna have a great time.	[garbage] I'm going to live on campus. I mean, well, around campus, anyway. Yeah, housing around campus.	Oh yeah.	Good tradeoff	I just want to be really close to things, you know. I know it's not exactly the best neighborhood in the entire world. But uh-	I don't- I don't think it's that bad.	I don't- you know ,I feel the same way, you know what I mean. And everybody says a lot of other crap you know, they don't know what they are talking about anyway.	yeah.	They don't live here. They don't know, right?	Yeah. I think it's really also if you- if you consider yourself like, us and them, kind of thing- If you think you're part of your community then --you going to like it more	yeah.	Exactly. You make it what you make it. You know? Right? And I'm gonna make it so freaking awesome.	Right, Exactly.	Oh I'm so glad.	yeah.	So when do you know, like, where you're gonna live? and-	Well, I don't know. I've got to go look for a place.	Oh, wow.	Yeah, yeah. I- I don't- I don't know. Do you have any suggestions?	Um-	You know the area better than I do.	Yeah. I mean, I know, I know, like the- the housing surrounding the campus pretty well.	Um- How many people do you want to live with?	Not a lot. I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people. So, like four of us total, right?	All dudes?	I don't care. I don't care.	Um- I think I have some friends.	yeah?	yeah.	That would be perfect.	There's actually, a friend of mine is um- moving out of her place and her place is amazing-- And it's really cheap.	Really?	Really?	yeah.	Cheap is exactly what I need- Because I have no money at all.	Okay.	But, uh--	Loans, scholarships, I've got a lot of scholarships-- Yeah, yeah. I'm- I'm half Native American so I get all those scholarships, too. yeah.	You've got a lot- oh, awesome.	Oh cool.	So it comes Indian like. And you know I'm kind of smart, so.	Yeah.	totally.	good for you.	And yeah, well, I mean, basically I just applied for any and every possible scholarship and grant that could come by, so I can go.	the way to do it.	Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's gonna work out. I'm gonna be able to pay for it, I'm gonna go, I mean, I'll have a little debt in the end. But I don't care.	Wow, are you so excited?	It's just you know a dream come true. How could you not be excited about a dream come true?	You're gonna be so busy, too. You're going to have to work so hard.	Oh I know, I know.	But I'm so looking forward to being so busy. You know what I mean? It's the kind of busy you've got to love, right?	Because you're doing something you love. That's the kind of busy you want. I want to be able to do that for the rest of my life. Be that kind of busy.	All right. Wow. So exciting.	I had to tell you right away. I knew you'd be excited.	We'll have fun.	Yeah. We'll have so much fun.	Great. Okay.	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	5	2	5	5	2	5	2	2	5	0	5	5	5	5	2	5	5	5	5	0	0	5	0	5	0	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	2	5	0	5	0	5	0	0	5	0	5	0	5	0	5	2	5	5	0	5	0	5	5	2	2	5	5	0	2	2	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	2	5
What he's going to say?	He saw it.	I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.	I don't know. But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.	Did you talk to him?	No. I figured I'd just let it wait.	Cried hard?	Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room.	[BREATHING]	What is he doing out here at that hour?	I don't know.	He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.	I guess he is.	I don't know the meaning of it. But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.	What do you mean a mistake?	I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh? Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?	What do you want to do, argue with him?	I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.	I got to.	What, can you prove it? What proof do you have? Can you prove it?	For God's sake, three years? Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.	To you it is, to me it is. But to your father? You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body. So where are you?	Okay, all right. Mom, sit down. I want to talk to you.	The trouble is those god damn news papers. Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--	Yeah, okay all right, all right. Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?	Why?	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Well, that's only your business, Chris.	You know it's not just my business.	Well, what do you want me to do? You're old enough known your own business.	So it's okay then? I'm just going to go ahead with it?	See. Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that? You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?	I'm just saying.	I'm sorry. I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.	She is not Larry's girl.	From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl. I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go. See, I don't know.	I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody. All my life...	You're a considerate fellow. There's nothing wrong in that.	To hell with that.	Did you ask Annie yet?	No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.	Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? Maybe she feels same way your father does.	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.	So what? I'm just--I'm not fast with women.	I don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.	I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her. She is what I think of when I think of a wife.	He thinks he's coming back, Chris. You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.	Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know? I don't.	I've given it lots of thought. And I keep coming back to the same thing.	When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.	I'll leave. I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.	Are you crazy?	You have a business here. I said what the hell is this?	Business? The business doesn't inspire me.	Oh, must you be inspired.	Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day. I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.	If that can't happen here...	Yes, on this I would.	Well, you don't want to think like that.	Then help me stay here mom.	All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for. This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.	Then help me stay.	Well, you don't think like that.	I am thinking like that.	I don't understand you, do I?	No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	Well, I can see that.	1	0	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	1	3	4	3	1	4	1	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	1	4	0	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	4	4	1	0	4	0	3	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	3	4	1	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	1	0	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	4
Can I help you sir?	Yes you can help me. Where is my luggage?	Well, let me just check on that for you. Where are you coming--?	Yeah. You do that. I'm coming from Baltimore. You know where that is?

Hi.	Hi. Thanks for waiting.	Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in.	Can I help you?	Uh huh.	I need my bag.	Okay.	I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines.	Okay.	I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times. They told me to go to the next one. I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.	Okay. Great. I'm really sorry that you had to do that. What's your last name? Let's start there.	Nash.	Okay.	all right- okay. And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?	Yes.	Flight seven fourteen.	Uh-huh.	Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?	Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--	I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-	we've mistakenly lost your baggage. We're very sorry. On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience. I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us. I'm very sorry, once again...	for such an inconvenience and your bag, but	Is this a joke?	Yeah.	No, no.	Are there candid cameras? Is this that movie? There's that show, right? Airplane, airline.	No, no. This is real.	No. I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone. If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...	this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.	You're kidding me, this is a joke.	Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars? That's supposed to replace everything that I have? Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that. It was incredibly expensive.	Yes.	I know.	We flew in from Paris. I've been shopping for three weeks.	I don't care what you're freaking sign says. Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.	Okay. Calm-	Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really	Do you understand who my husband is?	If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.	We are actually not even allowed-- you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars. We don't have to do that.	Oh-Oh. It's a gift. You're-You're helping me out here?	It's a gift.	You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.	You are cruising for a bruising. You are in so much trouble.	With the amount of--	Who's in charge? Who is the president of Jet Blue?	Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?	Because I probably know him.	Yeah.	Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money. But right now all I can do--	I don't want money, I want my clothes.	Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.	What's your name?	Oh. My name is Sean. Hi.	Okay. I'll do that.	I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.	If you want, you can write a letter. I can give you the address. Yes. An angry--	A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.	Or you can make a phone call. But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...	1	0	1	2	2	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	4	0	0	0	4	4	0	0	4	4	0	0	4	4	0	4	0	0	4	0	4	0	4	4	0	4	0	4	0	4	4	0	4	0
I wonder.	I don't care then.	Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.	Ah, it send shivers up my spine.	Behave exquisitely.	With the most perfect poise?	Oh, of course. I shall probably do a court curtsy.	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy. Do they?	What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	Oh, darling, don't say that.	It's true. The whole business is a very poor joke.	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	Yes, meaning just that.	You mustn't be serious, my dear one. That's just what they want.	Who's they?	All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at everything. All their sacred shibboleths.	Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	Certainly, you must. We're figures of fun, alright.	Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.	Who knows.	Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?	No, that desire will fade. Along with our passion.	Oh, dear, shall we like that?	Depends on how well we've played.	Well, what happens if one of us dies? I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?	Yes. Yes. With all his might.	No. No, it isn't. Death is very laughable. Such a cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors.	Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.	So is everyone else in the long run.	Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers. Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.	Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Elliott, worms don't pop.	I don't care what you do. See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word. As long as you love me best.	Oh, thank you, dear. The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	Which particular one?	The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.	Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.	Yes, I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	How long did that row last?	It went in intermittently for days.	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.	That was the first time you ever hit me.	I didn't hit you very hard.	The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.	Oh, I'll never forget his face.	It was ridiculous. Completely ridiculous.	We were very much younger then.	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	0	0	0	5	2	0	2	0	2	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	5	2	0	5	5	2	0	2	0	2	0	2	2	0	2	0	2	0	0	2	5	5	0	0
Why does that bother you?	Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	What are you talking about? He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that. He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.	Why do you think he's even thinking that?	He's got that about it.	Well, so what?	What's going on here, Joe?	Now listen.	How do you know why she's waited?	Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?	Well, what do you want me to do about it? What do you want?	I want you to pretend like he's coming back. Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here. I don't want any nonsense.	But Kate?	No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh! Laugh at me!	Calm yourself.	Calm yourself.	Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry. You read it yourself.	All right. All right.	You above all have got to believe.	What's that suppose to mean, me above all? Look at you, you're shaking.	I can't help it.	What have I got to hide, Kate? What the hell is the matter with you?	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	4	4

What do I need to do there that I can't do here?	Well, I have no camera here. I can't help you at all here, ma'am. I have forms for something completely different. You need to go to a different place.	Can you just-can I just get the right-	Simply step to line two A, ma'am, I'm sorry.	Would you be able to put me at the front of that line?	There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--	I know. I've been in line with these people. I understand. I understand what it's like. Could you please like call over and-	I don't want to be rude here, ma'am, but line two B is where you need to be. This is the line for registration.	I hear that. I hear that. Thank you, but I've waited in line for so long, and I don't want to have to be here all day.	I don't have those-	So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-	I don't have those forms, ma'am. I can't help you. That's why you need to go to line two A.	And how long is that going to take?	Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking. There seems to be a bit of a line there. It looks like thirty forty people. It could take four to five hours. I'm sorry.	I don't-	There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am.	I don't have time for this today, and-	But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line. There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.	Is there anything you can do? Please, have some compassion. Is there something you can do?	I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not. Of course, I'm compassionate. Look, I work in the D.M.V.. What do you think I am? Go wait in line two A.	Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself. I can't come back over there. I'll get security if you need me to.	Please, I don't think that's necessary. I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line. I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.	what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here.	No, they did. The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.	what The lady, what? the janitor?	No.	No, I'm not, I'm sorry.I'm not stupid.	I'm not saying that you're stupid, ma'am. I think you just said that you were stupid.	Isn't there anything you can do? Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.	It doesn't work that way here, ma'am.	Why not?	There is a strict system here. You need to wait in the right line for the right thing. This is the line for registration.	Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?	I told you it was line two A.	Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true.	I don't know who told you that but they were wrong. I'm sorry.	Do you have a manager I could speak with?	Are you being straight with me?	I'm being very straight with you, ma'am. There is nothing I can do for you. You need to stand in line two A.	Fine.	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	1

And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line. I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form	that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.

This is the wrong form. I'm sorry.	This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need.	I don't have the form.

You're gonna have to go get in that line over there. And they will give you a copy of the form.	But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--	Nope, I don't. I don't have-	or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.	No, I can't. That's-	I'm sorry.

I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours.	And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need. F: Sir, you can either go--	I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day. Maybe there will be a shorter line.	That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-	Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk	It's not rocket science.	Come -- just, please, just grab the form. It's right over there.	I can't do that.	Why are you being such a bitch?	I'm sorry, but I can't do that.	Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?	So go get in the other line or leave. Or I will have you escorted out by security.	Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.? You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?

What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight. This is great isn't it? Look at this night we've got here. It couldn't be better.	Fine.	Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it? I can't even tell	Oh, no you know what I did? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.	The flashlight, the silver one. There's only one isn't there?	It's not yours.	Well sure.	No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally. How could we not think to bring it?	I hope the moon stays out. I wonder do they always run during a full moon. I can't remember if it was full last year. Remember?	Are you cold? Do you want my jacket? We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.	Ah, this is great, isn't it? I didn't even think to bring a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.	It's after eleven let's go home.	Are you kidding? We'd miss it. We just got here. What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?	There is no point in coming down here.	Right.	That's my point.	That's my point too.	So let's go home.	No, no, no. That's not my point. My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?	Not particularly.	I just don't. It's stupid.	Honey this is natural phenomenon. I mean this only happens once a year. This is a great opportunity.	Think about the people in Kansas. They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this. We're just forty minutes away. It's too good to pass up.	Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.	This is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.	What are you so excited about? This isn't a moon landing we're talking about. It's fish. It's fish nobody even eats.	Yeah, they do.	Oh, Augie.	Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do	like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that. There's mystery here and magic	a little bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.	I'm just not.	Yes.	I don't get it. The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here. You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.	We weren't in a good spot.	We didn't see them the first time either.	We just weren't in a good spot. This is a much better spot.	I've got good instincts for these things. Look there. What's that. Is that? Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.	Ah, man this is great. I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean think about this. I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.	Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way. They don't know why. We don't know why. It wasn't a decision. They didn't take a vote.	No one sent them a map or an invitation. Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.	They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.	It's single mindedness with no mind. Urgency that's pure urge.	They don't know what drives them. They don't give it a name or ask question. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place	where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.	Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps. All my hairs are popping up.	That's the wind.	About what?	It's ridiculous.	2	0	5	1	1	1	1	1	5	0	2	4	1	4	1	1	0	1	1	1	4	1	5	4	1	5	4	1	1	1	5	1	4	4	1	1	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	1	4	4
What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	He saw it.	He was out here when it broke.	He's getting just like after he died. What's the meaning in that?	I don't know the meaning of it, mom. But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad.	What do you mean, dishonest?	What do you want to do? Argue with him?	I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.	You can't say that to him.	We've gotta say it to him.	How are you going to prove it? Can you prove it?	For God's sake, three years. Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.	To you it is and to me, but not to him. You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?	Alright, alright, alright. Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?	Why?	You know why.	Going to ask her to marry me.	Well that's only your business, Chris.	You know it's not only my business.	What do you want me to do? You're old enough to know your own mind.	Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --	Well, then you know it's not only my business.	I'm just saying.	Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that? Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.	I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.	She's not Larry's girl.	From father's point of view, he's not dead. And you have no right to take his girl.	Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go. See, I don't know.	Now what can I do for you?	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.	To hell with that.	I wanted to get this settled first.	How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way father does.	The trouble is, you don't see enough women. You never did.	I don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	Line?	Alright, then, mom.	Alright, then, mom. Did we skip something? No. Alright, then, mom.	Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?	Yeah, let's keep going.	Just give it some more thought.	I've given it three years' of thought. I'd hope that if	father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy. If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.	What the hell is this?	Are you crazy?	I've been a good son too long; a good sucker. I'm through with it.	You've got a business here. What the hell is this?	The business? The business doesn't inspire me.	Must you be inspired?	Yes. I like getting an hour a day. If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.	Yes, on this I would.	You don't want to think like that.	Then you help me stay here.	Alright. But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for? That's all for you, Chris. The whole shooting match is just for you.	I know that. Just you help me stay here.	But don't think that way, you hear me?	No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	0	0	0	3	1	1	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	1	0	1	0	0	1	4	0	4	1	4	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	3	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	0	4	0	4	1	4	1
I wonder.	what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	What do we do?	We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?	Now and always, my sweet.	I don't care then.	It was bound to happen sooner or later.	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.	With the worst- with the most perfect poise?	Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--	things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.	Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.	Um What does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth. Dear God, what does it all mean?	Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.	You mustn't be serious, darling. That's just what they want.	Who's they?	All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them, Be flippant. Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.	uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.	If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	Certainly you must. We are figures of fun all right.	Well, will we always bicker and fight?	No. That fire will fade along with our passion.	What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?	Yes, yes, with all his might.	No, no that is quit laughable. The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers. Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.	[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.	Elliott, worms don't pop.	I don't care what you do. See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word. As long as I know that you love me best.	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.	Horrible thing. I hated it.	I know you did. You threw it out the window into the Canal below. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	How long did that roue last?	Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?	Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.	[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?	Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.	I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]	We were very much younger then.	You knew there was nothing in that.	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	0	5	5	0	5	0	5	0	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0
So what do you think?	What I was saying.	It's ridiculous.	Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?	Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.	Well, what's bugging you?	We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.	For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.	Why not?	We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?	We've missed them twice; that's not ever.	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.	Well, we'll see them this year.	No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,	I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.	I thought you wanted to see them.	You don't understand anything I'm saying.	No of course not.	I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.	For heavens sake this isn't about fish.	All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.	You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said	the Grunion are running tonight, I said great, let's go, I feel lucky,	okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-	Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.	We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.	And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them	and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be	Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?	Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?	I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.	Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?	No.	You want to go get some champagne?	No.	Take off our shoes?	Get married again?	No.	What? What? You want a divorce?	No.	A vacation?	No.	A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want? F: No.	I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.	Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?	No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us	'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.	This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.	I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.	Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	No, I know. Me neither.	I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?	I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Maybe if you were with somebody else too.	No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.	Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?	You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.	Now that you mention it. No, I don't.	I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.	What have we got here?	Well, I guess we don't need glasses.	Augie, I'm sorry.	Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.	Or not.	Or not.	Hmm.	0	0	1	0	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	4	1	1	1	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	3	3	3	3	5	5	3	0	3	0	3	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	3	3	1	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	2	2	3	2	2	2	0
Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?	Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.	You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?	Fine.	Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.	Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?	Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.	Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?	I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?	We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.	I hope the moon stays out.	Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?	We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.	You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.	I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].	I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.	Do you want my jacket?	Right.	Yeah, that's my point too.	No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.	I mean, don't you want to see it?	Not particularly.	Why not?	I don't know. I just don't.	Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.	Oh, God, Augie.	Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.	No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.	We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-	I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.	And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.	You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.	its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.	They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here	where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps.

As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	You let him kiss you. You said you did.	What of it?	What of it?	What about me?	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	Oh, dear. I'm bored with this conversation.	No thanks.	I'll have some myself, I think.	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.	It's become a habit with you.	Oh, don't be so stupid.	Really, Amanda.	What?	Nothing.	Going somewhere, my dear?	Just making myself fascinating for you.	The woman's job is to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you.	Oh, no it isn't	It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.	Adders don't snap they sting.	They sting.	I don't care, okay. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	Yes, I did quite a lot.	Mind your own business.	You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.	I'm not in the least drunk.	You always had a weak head.	I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long. A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.	On, the contrary. A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	Oh, shut up.	Not very funny, dear. You'd better have some more brandy.	Very good idea. I will.	Why?	There is no one upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.	There are people downstairs I suppose.	This is no time of year for Tunis.	Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	Turn it off. It's driving me mad.	You're far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.	Go away, go away. I hate you.	Amanda, listen.	Listen? Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you. You damn sadistic bully.	Stop.	Very amusing.	Stop, stop. I hate you. Do you hear? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.	This is the end do you understand? The end,	You're not going like this.	finally and forever	Oh, I am. Let go of me.	You're not.	Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again? Never, never, never.	Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.	You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.	I'd rather die in torment. Beast. Brute.

You're not sorry you came?	No. I'm not sorry. But I'm not going to stay.	Look,	you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...	What?	Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.	I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.	Well,	I love you.	I guess that's why I came.	Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.	Look, I almost got married two years ago.	You started to write me.	You felt something that far back.	Every day since.	I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?	You'd always be so ambiguous.	Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...	Oh God. Annie, I kissed Annie. I kissed Annie.	I'll never forgive you for that.	I mean, Why did you wait all these years? There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.	We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.	Not like that you're not.	Nothing. Hey, let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.	You remember overseas I was in command of a company?	Well I lost them.	How many?	Just about all.	Geez.	Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.	For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.	That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.	A little more selfish and they'd still be here today. And I got this idea watching them go down. See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.	It was a kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?	And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.	And then I came here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in it here. The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.	And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed. Somehow because nobody was changed at all.	It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys. I felt wrong to be alive. I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,	open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator	cause you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.	Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.	And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.	And you still feel that way?	that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money. Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.	Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.	What am I going to do with a fortune?	Buy some hats?	0	3	3	3	0	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	5	2	2	2	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2
You okay?	Yeah, I'm just-- yeah	Just kind of feel numb, you know.	What's happened?	You didn't even hear?	[BREATHING] Umm.	God I've told this story so many times. Umm.	You don't have to if you don't want to.	I just...I just basically lost someone that was really close to me.	And I've kind of been dealing with all of the...the stuff, you know the hospital and people work because...	I'm sorry to hear that.	He kind of didn't have anyone to take care of that for him, so--	You've been taking care of it all? M: Yeah.	Oh Jesus.	It's just really...really messed up.	He sick for awhile?	No.	Just like it.	Was it an accident?	No, I mean it just came on really quick, you know I mean it was a [GARBAGE] it was a sickness but it just --	how was sick?	What?	Well, I'm confused. He was sick or it was an accident?	He was sick. He got sick. He got sick but it happened really, really fast, you know.	Oh. Really fast? Oh.	It was kind of like boom... done	Yeah.	It's just really weird because he was really young you know and it kind of like...	Yeah.	--it just kind of freaks you out.	Totally, yeah.	So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff. You just like used to take for granted--you know.	Mmhmm.	Lock	Mmhmm.	The plans you make [GARBAGE].	Exactly, you know, and like he had so many plans and he was going to do...	It leaves a hole for you too. F: Mmhmm.	so many things, you know?	It leaves a hole for you too, in your plans together.	What?	Yeah.	It gets better.	He was a really, really good guy.	Mmhmm.	A lot of people loved him.	MMhmm.	You know, it's like affecting a lot of people it's not just me, you know?	Mmhmm.	How long did you know each other?	Umm...	For like eight years.	That's a long time.	Yeah.	It's good that you were there.	Yeah, I'm glad I was there. Glad I- glad I got to be there.	So weird,	Yeah.	like I can't...it's like you know it's like pinch me it's like I can't believe like I'm dealing with this, you know.

I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.	No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.	I could hear him right through the floor in my room.	You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	What do you want to do, argue with him?	No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.	Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?	You can't say that to him.	We've got to say it to him.	Can you prove it, how can you prove it?	For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.	To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?	All right. All right. Listen to me.	You know why I brought Annie here don't you? F: Why?	You know.	I got an idea but what's the story?	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	No it's not only my business.	What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.	So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?	Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-	See it isn't just my business-	I'm just saying	She's not Larry's girl.	From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.	You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?	I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.	You're a considerate fellow. There's nothing wrong with that.	To hell with that.	Have you asked Annie yet?	I wanted to get this settled first.	How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.	Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.	I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.	Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.	So what I'm not fast with women.	I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.	I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.	I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.	Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?	If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.	What the hell is this?	I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.	What the hell is this, are you crazy?	I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.	What about the business? What is this?	The business? The business doesn't inspire me.	Must you be inspired?	Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.	Tell me, you'd leave the business?	Yes, on this I would.	Well, you don't want to think like that.	Then help me stay here.	I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.	Just don't go thinking that way.	Well, I am thinking that way.	I don't understand you, do I?	Yea, I can see that.	3	3	3	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	4	1	1	0	1	4	0	4	1	0	0	0	3	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	1	1	1	1	1	3

And your name is?	Olivia.	Olivia. Um. Okay. So how long has this problem been?	This has been going on for the past two weeks. I called every single day. Nobody is helping me. You guys tell me the same thing over and over, call again, call again, call again--	So what exactly is the problem?	I don't, I don't know what the problem is. That's what I want you guys to...why is my service not turned on? And I paid my bills on time. I don't understand.	Um- I think part of it has to do with the network being down. It's been having some trouble the last few weeks--	Okay. Well that is, that is fine and all. I don't care. I really don't care because I want my phone to work that's all.	That is I am paying you guys for service and I'm not getting any service. I get, I get just dropped calls all the time and now it's completely not working at all. I can't even call out, nine one one probably wouldn't even work.	I understand--we're not-	No. Okay. We're not charging you for any of these months. We're going to give you three months free.	Well you better. You better give me a whole freaking new phone that's what you better do.	We can give you a new phone--	I want a camera phone actually.	We can do that. We can do that. You just have to sign a one-year contract though with the--	No, no, no... I'm done with these contract business because this is what can happen.	You sign the contract and then down the line the phone doesn't work and you're stuck, you can't go to a new...no. No contracts for me. You give me a new phone.	Besides, it's sort of out of hands at the moment----The whole electrical power outage.	I want to talk to a supervisor	I would like to talk to your supervisor. Obviously you're incompetent and don't understand what I'm asking.	Um- Let me connect you to my supervisor. Actually, he's out right now so I'm supervisor until he comes back. Um-	What?	So you could----speak with me some more, you could call back later on maybe.	That's ridiculous. You know?	No I don't want to call back, you put me on hold for like hours and hours----and it's money, money, money, money and out of my pocket, out of my pocket--	I didn't put you on hold.	There are a lot of people calling us having problems. Every phone company is having the same problems ma'am	Every phone...every single phone company?	Mmm hmmm. Mmm hmmm. The power outages, everything, hurricane Katrina. Everything's really messed up.	This is ridiculous.Well what are we supposed to do? We starve then because I can't use my phone cause	I am a realtor and this is my business. People are calling me all the time but you know, and I don't have a land line. I can't afford to have a land line	don't you-	I'm really sorry ma'am. There's not----a lot we can do for it.	That you better be sorry.	Well you're not helping me at all. God this is so frustrating.	What I can do for you, if you want to make a call right now I could contact you through our computer. I can call through my phone and you can speak through me.	What? No. That's way too complicated. Look--	you need to fix my phone. I don't care what you have to do--	I'm sorry it has to do with an electrical power outage and stuff--	Well, okay I'm going to give you a free phone card that you can use at any payphone and that's on us. Okay?	Yeah yeah, woman going out in South Central on the payphone at night. Oh that's real safe.	I'm, I'm sorry you chose to live there um--	No, no, no. I didn't choose to live here. I work there. Okay? Yeah. work work work	Well I'm sure maybe there's a phone at work you could use.	We can't call out. We can't make out-- line. I don't work, I work at another office.	A law firm. Thank you very much.	All right um--	I work out of my home as a realtor and because I don't have a land line, I need a phone and because of now I don't have one I don't know what to do. And you're not helping me at all.	In fact, give me your name sir, what's your name again?	My name is Sara.	Okay. Sara what?	Sara Brown.	Sara Brown. Sara Brown, um- yeah, I'm going to get off the phone with you. And then I'm going to call back and I'm going to give your supervisor your name because you're obviously incompetent to work here.	You know maam, we record this conversation so anything you say can be proven in a law of court so keep that in mind.	What are you, what are you a police officer now? You know, like I'm done, I'm over it. Goodbye and I hope that you lose your job.	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	4	1	4	4	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	4	4	0	0	4	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1
It's almost time for me to go.	There's nothing I can do. I mean, the government you know--	What--what're we gonna do here? I can't--I can't do this by myself. I--	You're gonna have to. I mean, you're a great father. You can do it. I know you can.	But, I'm--I'm nothing--I'm nothing without you here. Maybe we can--we can get out of this somehow.	I don't think so.	Well, come on. You've gotta think of something. A year--a year away, it's gonna tear us apart. I don't even--I don't even wanna think about it. I mean, I don't even know if I'll be able to get in touch with you or--	Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile. M: It's not...	You could send me pictures.	What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there? I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because--	Their not gonna let you. You have to stay home and I have to go. I mean, that's all--	and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger. You know? She has to stay.	This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up. She's gonna need you.	I know, but, she needs to be safe more. She needs to be around kids her age--own age. She needs to be able to play on the streets and--	But she's--you're not gonna--you're not gonna be here for--for her first words. For her first steps. I mean--it's something that you're supposed to be here for that--	You can just remember it for me.	I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was--	Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it.	I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know	I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing. I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but--	...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow. You know--we could--we could do this together.	I don't want you in danger. And I don't want her in danger.	I have no choice. There's nothing I can do. M: Well--I mean--	All right.	3	3	1	3	1	3	1	3	3	1	3	3	1	3	3	3	1	3	3	1	1	3	3	3
