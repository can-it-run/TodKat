Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened. I don't um- I mean what you can you do? I mean it's-	Thanks.	When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it.	You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened. I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know.	Mmhmm. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's- it's hard. It's hard.	I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?	Yeah.	Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,	Yeah. I know. I know.	you know, it's inevitable and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like	you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.	It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.	Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair. I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was- M: Yeah.	He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do. You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.	Yeah.	It just doesn't seem fair.	It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them. F: Right.	You're okay	Thank you for being here. M: You're welcome.	You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.	[LAUGHTER] You're probably right. He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.	Yeah.	And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER]	That's right. That's right. I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.	Yeah, I know.

Look sir, I've been waiting for about an hour and my luggage still hasn't come. What's going on?	I'm sorry, Mrs. Rosenkrantz, but uh- I don't know what to tell you.	What do you mean, you don't know what to tell me? I have two luggage that I've been coming--they're coming--from France and I need them here. I'm home now. I need to go start working.	Did you- Did you check with the lost and found?	Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?	I had my luggage transferred here from Paris to L.A. and now I'm here and I need to be working and I have all my stuff in there.	Maybe it got lost. Did you think about that, mom?	Well, that's what I'm asking you. What--I don't know what happened to it.	Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it.	Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?	No, I mean, maybe in the little--going around thingy thing where bopper stole it from there.	Okay. All I know is that I am supposed to have my language here right now. Right now. And it's not there. And you're supposed to help me because you work at the airport. So give me my luggage or tell me where the hell it is.	Okay. What can we do is we can get your name and information and if it shows up we can send it to you so-- Wherever you stay	What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.	Not to mention I have my work in there.	Well, I'll have you fill out some paperwork and see if you can get started on something.	And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?	and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.	Fifteen percent?	Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.	What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.	Whoa, maybe you should uh- have thought of a better way to send it than just in a bag, hmm? Did you think about that?	No, no, no. You don't understand. This is--these are my belongings in the luggage. And I went to Paris.	Sir, why are you laughing at me? This isn't funny.	I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.	Did you lock- Did you lock it even? You probably didn't even lock it.	No, they said I couldn't lock it.	Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.	Okay, let me get him.Oh, guess who the supervisor is? It's me.	What, do you have questions?	Well, get- I want the C.E.O. then.	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	0	4	1	1	1	4	4	1	4	0	4	0	4	1	1	1	0	1	4	4	0	0	4
Ahh. It sent shivers up my spine.	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	Behave exquisitely.	With the most perfect poise.	Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	Don't say that, my darling.	It's true the whole business is very poor joke.	Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.	Who's they?	Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?	Well who knows?	What happens if one of us dies? Does the one that's left still laugh?	Thank you, dear. The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?	Which particular one?	The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.	Oh, Charles. That was his name. Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.	Horrible thing. I hated it.	Yes, I know you did. You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	How long did that row last?	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.	It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.	Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers. F: Oh dear	How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	And very much sillier.	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	0	5	0	0	5	0	5	0	5	0	5	0	0	5	5	5	5
I don't care then.	No. Wrong number. [LAUGHTER]	[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER]	We'll behave exquisitely.	With perfect poise.	I think I shall do a curtsy.	It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy. Do they?	Yes. Meaning just that.	Well what does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. Dear God, what does it all mean?	Don't laugh at me. I'm being serious.	Who's they?	Who knows?	Yes. Yes with all of his might.	Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh? Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.	[LAUGHTER]	Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.	Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.	Oh See, I don't care what you do, see. You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world. I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.	Aw. Thank you, darling. The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.	Oh Charles, that was his name. He did wiggle so beautifully.	That was a rouser, wasn't it?	The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER] How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]	[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.	[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.	5	2	2	2	5	2	5	2	2	2	2	5	2	5	5	2	2	2	2	2	5	2	2	2	2	2
A good friend of mine passed away the other day.	Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?	Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,	metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-	That's the worst. I'm so sorry. Did you know him well?	Yeah. We were. Pretty close.	[BREATHING]	I am so sorry, It's-	It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?	Kind of.	It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.	Absolutely, absolutely.	It's the think	I just, I don't know.	There's no reason for it.	I know.	And he could of... He was pretty awesome	Yeah? What'd he do? What did they do? How'd you know him?	Uh, We grew up together.	yeah.	Is he an actor too, or-?	Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.	I feel really bad for his family, you know.	Yes of course, of course.	It must be really, really hard to lose a child.	Was he very close to his family?	Yeah. And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-	yeah.	[BREATHING]	I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.	Of course not. You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.	Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.	Thank you.	Is there a funeral planned? or-	Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something.	Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.	Thanks.	No problem.	It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...	something happens and they die and it's like-	really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.	Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real. It doesn't feel real.	yeah.	[BREATHING]	Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know. It'll get easier I guess.	yeah.	That's the best way to put it.	It's hard to say good-bye.	Absolutely.	[BREATHING]	Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.	yeah yeah.	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	0	3	3	3	3	0	3	0	3	3	3	3	3	0	3	0	3	0	3	3	3	3	0	3	0	3	0	3	0	3	0	3
Sweetheart, I've got to tell you something. I just got a call. I'm going to Iraq.	I know it's really crappy timing, but I don't have a choice.	I don't have a choice. I have to go. If I don't go, they'll come and take me.	No, we have- There's got to be something you can do. You can't go.	I've tried everything. I've called everyone I know. I've tried everything. No one can do anything for me or they won't do anything for me.	I know.	I don't want to -- the kids. You've got to take care of them. You've got- you've got to-	tell them about me and show them pictures of me and everything like that, because they are not going to see me for such a long time. And it's such an important time and I just don't want to miss it.	There's got to be something we can do. You can't just go.	I don't have -- I know. What are we gonna- What are we- just run away? What can I do? Where can we go?	Why don't we do that- Can we- Can we just leave the country?	What would be the worst that would happen if they found you somewhere else?	They'd put me in jail and then how long- when will I get to see the kids? What, ten years? I don't know.	Well, they're so young.	I know. But I'll-I'll send the pictures all the time and I'll write them emails and you can read them the emails that I send them.	I'm gonna be in Bagdad, just doing security.	I just want to be honest with you. I don't want you to .	but, it's gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. You know I'm good at this. I can do this. That's why I trained all this time. I'm good at this. Okay?	I know. I know. I know. But, you know what? That doesn't mean it's gonna be me; does it?	No. It doesn't. And you can't think like that.	I don't want you to -- I know. I know. You can't worry about me. You've got to worry about the kids. And you've got to take care of the kids for me. Okay? Take care of the kids for me; all right?	It's just so much.	I'll miss you, baby.	[GARBAGE] You have to write me everyday.	All- I'll write you everyday, all the time. And I'll send you pictures and you send me pictures. I know We've got email out there. We've got email and I can see stuff and you can send me stuff all the time. Okay?	yeah yeah yeah.	You you record every second. You record every second because I want to see it all. Okay?	okay.

Hi, sir. How can I help you?	Oh, thank God. Do you know how long I've been on the phone for half an hour trying to talk to a freaking human being.	All I want to do is put my, pay for my freaking credit card, and there's something wrong in my bill, Like I swear, it says I didn't paid last month, but I know I paid last month.	Okay.	I put- I've been typing my number in millions of times, it won't listen to me, it's not working, and I can't get a single human being, and finally-	[LAUGHTER] All right. I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.	This is ridiculous. I- I seriously, I don't understand why you think these automated systems are supposed to like work for anybody. They have never, ever work for me.	I kwon, it is ridiculous	yeah, I understand.	Can you like talk to somebody about this, can you like can you tell them that this is ridiculous and can they change it from now on, is there a phone number you have that I can call that will like automatically be talking to somebody a human being.	Uh- when's when's-	Sir-	If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it.	Well, okay ,well First off, fine, fine, fine. Let's see, first off, um- yeah my bill's wrong.	Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.	Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?	I got it in the mail.	In the mail?	yeah	So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?	Well, when I look online, it says, it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site-	Okay.	like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there, and then it charged me the late fee afterwards.	Okay.	Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...	Okay.	if I call it up on the screen.	Okay, great, go ahead.	So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?	It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.	Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason. And I think that was the problem on our end. So um-	Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-	No, No, No, I am grateful.	Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.	Did they take-	You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?	Yes, yes, exactly.	Yeah so- That --that did go through.	Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?	Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.	Because I paid it on time.	Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well. So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer. And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.	Right.	Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.	Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can get directly to me.	yeah.	That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously.	No problem.	thank you, what's the number?	ahh one eight hundred three two three	three two three	six four nine four	six four nine four. That would be so great, thank you so much.	You're welcome	I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.	It was horrible, but you've made it much better, thank you very much. Absolutely	Have a good day.

And very much sillier.	However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Oh. You knew there was nothing in that.	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	Presents? It was only a trivial, little brooch.	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	I did not. You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.	Well, you let him kiss you, huh? You said you did.	Well, what of it?	What about me?	Oh dear. I'm bored with this conversation.	So am I. I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE] Do you want some brandy?	I'll have a little, I think.	No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.	You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.	Oh. Don't be so grand. Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.	Don't be stupid.	Really, Amanda.	What?	Nothing.	you going out somewhere, dear?	No. I am just making myself fascinating for you.	Oh. It's a woman's duty to allure the man.	Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.	No it isn't.	Yes it is.	You shut up.	Oh really. It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.	Snap, snap, snap. You know you are like a little adder.	Nonsense. They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.	They sting. I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.	Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	Yes I did, quite a lot.	And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes. I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh? All out, no restraint at all. Well, you never really had much anyhow.	Mind your own business.	You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.	I think I am not in the least bit drunk.	You've always had a weak head.	I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long. A child of two cannot get drunk on that.	On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four? Or a child of six? Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.	Oh shut up.	Shut up.	Not very funny, darling. Why don't you have some more brandy.	Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.	Why?	There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.	Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.	They are away in Tunis.	This is no time of year for Tunis.	I will do no such thing.	Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.	You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.	Turn it off.	I won't. Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen? I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.	Amanda, listen, listen.	Oh. That's very amusing indeed.	Oh shut up. Let go. I hate you, I hate you. Do you hear? You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.	This is the end. Do you hear me? Finally and forever.	You're not going like this.	Oh. Yes I am.	You're not.	Yes I am. Stop it. Stop it. Let go of me. Oh. You're a cruel fiend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again? Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.	Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.	2	0	2	0	2	0	0	1	0	4	1	1	0	0	1	1	4	4	4	1	0	4	4	0	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	0	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
All right. Finally. Here you go.	Hi, How can I help you?	Yea. I just want to get this done,	Sure, um	get my new license.	do you have two forms of ID with you?	Um, no, I got my driver's license though.	I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.	Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -	Well	well is the dri-driver's license going to work?	I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.	Okay, so what are you saying? What-	Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.	What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after	Well, I'm sorry sir but	three hours and	you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it.	Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?	Well, it's actually-	It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID, I'm sorry.	It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my	Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not responsible.	I filled out the application right, didn't I?	Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID.	Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back-	I'm sorry, but there is a lot of people waiting so you're just going to have to get in line again.	I've been waiting for three hours.	It just happens to people all the time, I'm sorry sir, but I can't make an exception for you.	This is ridiculous. Come on	I'm sorry, sir.	I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean-	there is nothing I can do.	I know sir, but we have to have two forms. There is nothing I can do about it, I'm sorry.	That doesn't make any sense. Why?	I'm sorry, sir. There is nothing I can do.	You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application	Well, if you had checked the web site it would have said.	If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification.	What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.	Well, maybe you should	I waited in line now I'm ready to get my stuff and then go home.	Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.	I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security.	God, oh my-	This is ridiculous.	I'm sorry, sir, it's not my choice.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	4	1	4	1	4	1	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	4	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1

He finally proposed. I'm getting married.	Holy shit that's amazing.	I know. I'm so-	Congratulations.	Thank you. [LAUGHTER]	I'm invited, right.	You think. [LAUGHTER]	Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know. So we are going to get married in the meadow. M: A meadow?	We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER]	Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff.	So pretty.	Very Midsummer Night's wedding.	Thanks. Thanks a lot. You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies.	Okey Well- well-, you know what? I was hoping that you would help	plan everything. So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears. M: Plan?	Yeah. I'll help plan.	Yeah?	Really?	Okay. It's going to be in, like, six months. So we don't have a really long time.	Why not browns?	It's a light brown, tanish.	I just think browns are really what you want to go with. I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is- F: Well, yeah, but	I know but you just asked me to- M: Yeah, I know.	Come on. Please will you do the greens and browns, just the browns for me? F: Come on. M: I'm not trying to ruin your mood.	Okay. Fine. So green and what? F: Umm.	Blue?	Okay, fine. Greens and blues.	Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?	Yeah?	Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow. Maybe some yellow flowers.	Okay. That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?	I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come. So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet. F: Yeah	Yes.	Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.	because you're going to take care of everything. You're going to think of all the details that I forget.	Well I can't be in charge of this. I mean I got things I got to do.	Well this is really exciting. I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.	I'm thrilled. God.	Ha ha ha.	Ha ha.	Just ecstatic. I can't believe you're my best friend	Just couldn't be any cooler.	You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing	I know. I've been waiting forever. I can't believe it's finally happening.	Wow. I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.	I'm so- all the blood	You don't look like you're going to faint.	has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly. F: Uhuh.	I'm getting a little weak in the knees.	So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?	You haven't ruined it yet. F: Maybe we'll get married.	You really like	I don't know. Okay. I mean gosh. There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.	You could make her that excited. You really like her. You guys have been together for a really long time now.	[LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.	[laughter]	5	0	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	5	2	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	5	0	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5
Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?	I can't -- how did you do it? What happened?	[LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.	Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know.	Did she cry?	She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...	Oh, my God. How long have you been planning on doing this?	Honestly, it was kind of quickly. It was actually only in the past couple months.	I can't believe this. You're getting married. It's crazy!	Yeah. Yeah. So- I know. I know. I know. It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.	Yeah, it is.	But uh- no, I mean, you know. You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of	Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]	Okay. Well there you go.	Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--	Oh, my God. M: Yeah. F: Just have fruit. F: Tropical.	Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier? Like in a church.	Barefoot?	Well I don't know. Throwing it out there.	Yeah. But I'm really excited. So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time. And--	It's so exciting. What's the ring look like?	It's big and shiny. I don't know. It's silver and--	Big and shiny. You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]	Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-	I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-	Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-	Yeah, yeah.	It's fantastic. I -- congratulations. It's amazing. M: Thank you.	Thank you. I'm really -- I'm really excited. And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.	But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her. So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing. And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it. So we're going to do it.	And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding. And, um, maybe some greens and blues.	She's okay with it.	Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.	All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request. F: All fruit, haha.	This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]	Yeah. Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.	All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]	So, um, anyway, do you want to order now? So, um I mean--	5	5	5	2	5	2	5	2	5	2	5	2	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	5	2	2	5	5	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	5	0
Well, so? What do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	I am not the only one, look at all these people.	I am sorry. It's just fish to me.	Carla, can I ask you a question? Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	God damn it, Augie. Why do you always ask things like that? It's so insulting.	What's bugging you?	I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.	There's nothing to it. We come down here. The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing. And we say, Oh, wow. Look at the little fish. They go home, we go home.	For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.	Why not?	We never do. Have we ever? We never have.	We miss them twice, it's not ever.	Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.	Well We will see them this year.	No, we won't. Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come. I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	I thought you wanted to see it.	I did, I do want to see it. I always want to see it, Augie.	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking, Finally, finally. I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Wait a minute, I got it.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	I rather not remember some things. I rather not hope for some things.	Okay, all right I got it. You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	No.	You want me to go get some champagne?	No.	Take off our shoes?	No.	You want to get married again?	What? What You want a divorce?	No no.	A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle? A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla? What the hell do you want?	I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.	What. Welcome to the human race.	No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.	This what? What is this? This isn't even anything.	Sure, this is standing. This is waiting. This is fighting.	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	No, I know me either.	I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	I didn't say that.	No, I know, but. I know I don't make you happy.	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you. I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	Actually, now that you mention it. No, I don't.	Good. So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.	I don't know. Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.	Yes, I did notice that. It does look really beautiful on the water. The gold white moon.	Well, look what we have got here.	No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.	Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	Or not.	5	1	0	0	1	0	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	3	2	0	3	3	5	3	5	3	5	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2
You're the only one who still loves his parents.	I know. It kind of went out of style, didn't it?	It's not so bad; it's a good thing.	[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here. The air is sweet.	You're not sorry you came.	I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.	For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.	Well.	And then, you. You've been kind of...	What?	Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.	Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so. They just take it for granted that we're all set.	I knew they would.	Well sure, from your mother's point of view. Why else would I come?	I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.	[BREATHING]	I love you. Annie, I love you.	[LAUGHTER]	I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.	[LAUGHTER]	Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch. I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.	No. No	Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.	I almost got married two years ago.	You started to write me.	Every day since.	Why didn't you let me know?	Give me a...	Give me a kiss.	beating around the bush. F:[LAUGHTER]	I will never forgive you. All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.	Oh Annie, we are going to live now. I am going to make you so happy.	Not like that you're not.	I kissed you.	Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.	Hey, let's drive some place. Huh? Let's get out of here.	No it's nothing like that. It's-	Yeah. I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.	I don't even know how to start.	It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know? You know overseas I was in command of a company?	Yeah, sure.	Well I lost them.	How many?	Pretty much all.	Aw, geez.	You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?	Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. He just put them in my pocket. That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.	They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other. I mean that, exactly. Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.	Mmhmm.	To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.	But then I came home and it was incredible, you know? The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident. You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.	And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.	I just want you to know Annie.	What would I do with a fortune?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	0	0	0	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	0	3	3	3	3	3	0	3	0	3	3	3	3	3	0	3	3	3	0	2
You seem kind of down.	It's--I've been trying to find this job I can't get any job.	It's not fair.	What do you mean?	I mean I've been looking for a job for like three years and I can't get a job. I mean like, it's America, right? I should be able to get a job.	There's a lot of people looking for jobs.	I guess. But three years? I mean, I like--I went to college even, I mean I didn't finish but I went for like a little bit. It's not fair, I don't know.	I don't know, I mean, I just don't think...	I mean I've been sending out my resumes and doing everything I can do but nothing is happening. You know, it's like I can't and I can't keep living on loans anymore like this. I'm going to--I mean eventually I'm going to have to pay it back. I'm just kind of freaking out, I don't know.	Did you ever think it might be your attitude that's...	I don't know just sometimes you get kind of... No, I'm not saying that. I just--	No, well maybe it's because I'm like frustrated 'cause I can't get a job, you know.	...has anyone ever just said anything like that to you before?	Like it's really hard to like shake that off when you go into like audition a room or whatever, you know what I mean?	Right, sure.	But I mean you kind of got to, you got to fake it 'til you feel it, right?	I guess I just getting really hard to fake, you know.	I'm just saying that if I was looking to hire somebody in the--or kind of... No. No. No.	Are you hiring? Wait, do you know of a job? Seriously, do you know, like do you know of anything though? Like, oh please, do you know of anything?	No. I'm just saying though that if I was a person who was hiring somebody I-- --would not hire someone who was angry or upset.	Yeah.	I come across angry?	No.	What?	Well, you know a little. If you were to listen to--	Okay. You're my friend you can tell me stuff. You can tell me honestly stuff, okay? Please.	I just don't want you to fly off the handle.	Okay, I'm not flying off the handle I don't think I'm flying off the handle here at all.	You kind of have a short fuse.	I have a short fuse?	Yeah.	Okay. Okay no, no, no, no okay no, I need to hear this more. Come on, bring it.	Like this, right now we're trying have a conversation.	We're trying to have a conversation and you seem extremely hostile. You keep cutting me off. M: [BREATHING]	I'm not always right I'm just--	I can't finish the sentence with you without you jumping in...	...and you're always right.	You have an excuse for everything.	[BREATHING]	I'm just saying that maybe you should take in some information before you produce more of your own.	I'm like a sponge I'm like soaked up with all this information for like three years I'm just dying for a job to like put it in to.	[BREATHING]	That's -.	You know, and like I don't think it's that much to ask. I know.	Well, what kind of field are you looking to go into?	That's it.	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	4	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	4	0	1	1	0	0
So what do you think?	About what?	About what I just said?	It's ridiculous.	It certainly is not. It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	It's PR. I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.	I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.	Yeah. Everyone else was sold the same thing. I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.	Are we talking about the same thing?	Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.	I thought you wanted to see it.	There's nothing to it. The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know? We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.	For heavens sake, grow up. We're not going to see the Grunions.	Why not?	We never do, do we? Have we ever?	Oh my gosh. We missed them twice, that's hardly ever.	Okay. Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.	Carla, can I ask you something?	Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?	Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.	What's bugging you then?	Look, it's pointless. It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...	Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.	I thought you wanted to see it.	God, you don't understand anything.	No, of course not.	I do. I always do. I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.	Well, we're going to see it.	No we won't. I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.	What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment.	Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.	And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on.	Look, do you remember the first time we came here?	We thought I was pregnant.	Wait a minute. I've got it.	It was in the car right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...	And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.	You want this to be like the other time right? That's it right?	I'd rather not remember something...	Rather not hope for something.	No.	Do you want me to get some champagne?	No.	Take off our shoes?	No.	What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?	No.	No...No...No...	No...	I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.	Welcome to the human race.	Do you think that this is what I had in mind? That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish? No.	I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...	...and you know? Baby the jokes on us. Because you know what you get? Do you know what you get Carla? You get this.	This what...what's this? This isn't anything. Alright. Sure. Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.	Yes it is.	Right.	Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.	This is just this. You know? I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?	I'm trying to do the best I can.	I know you are Augie. I know you wanted this evening to be nice.	I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Maybe if you were with someone else too.	I didn't say that.	I know. But I know I don't make you happy.	Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.	If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you. Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.	Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.	I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.	Yeah. I noticed that. It's real pretty on the water.	Hey, look what we got here.	Oh you brought refreshments.	No I'm beginning to think you might be right.	I think this may be the place for us after all.	I am sorry Augie.	Shh. If we're very quiet the fish might come.	Or not.	Or not.	5	4	1	4	1	4	1	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	4	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	0	4	1	0	1	1	3	0	0	0	0	3	3	3	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	3	1	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2
Did you talk to him?	He cried hard?	What was he doing out here at that hour?	What do you want to do argue with him?	Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him? Do we contradict him? Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore? That we haven't had hope for years now?	You can't say that to him.	We've got to say it to him.	Can you prove it? How can you prove it?	For God sakes, it's been three years. Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.	To you it is and to me, but not to him. I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?	All right. All right. Listen to me. You know why I brought Annie here don't you?	I've got an idea, but what's the story?	I'm gonna ask her to marry me.	Well, that's only your business, Chris.	You know it's not only my business.	What do you want me to do? You're old enough to know your own mind.	So it's all right then?	I'll go ahead with it?	Well, then it isn't just my business--	I'm just saying that--	She's not Larry's girl.	From your father's point of view, he isn't dead. And you've no right to take his girl.	And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go. See, I don't know. Now what can I do for you?	I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life. Time after time after time.	You're a considerate fellow. There's nothing wrong with that.	To hell with that.	[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?	Well, how do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.	Well, if she does, then that's the end of it. But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him. I'll find out. And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.	Trouble is, you don't see enough women.	You never did.	I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything. I mean, you've been away for--at war. It's been five years.	These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?	I don't want a diagram. Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris. You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.	I mean, what's gonna happen to your father? Do you know? I don't.	All right. All right, then, Mom.	I just--give it some more thought.	I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.	Are you crazy?	I've been a good son too long. A good sucker. I'm through with it.	What about the business? What the hell is this?	The business? The business doesn't inspire me.	Must you be inspired?	Yes. I like it an hour a day. If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.	Yes, on this I would.	Well, you don't want to think like that.	I know. I know, Mom. Just help me stay here.	All right. Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?	I am thinkin' that way.	I don't understand you, do I?	No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	I can see that.	3	3	3	1	4	1	1	1	4	1	1	3	0	0	1	4	1	1	4	0	4	1	1	1	0	4	0	0	3	3	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	1	1	0	1	0	3
Uhm, I don't know	So how you feeling?	I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean	I have got to get a job, you know? Like-	You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?	Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-	Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -	I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.	you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.	But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or	Well, but you care about what you do, right?	I don't know, I mean why - why	Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know. F: Yeah	I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh	I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.	Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.	Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else. F: No it means you have persistence.	You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's	I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.	Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.	I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and	I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and	I'm sorry.	I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking	maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.	Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.	Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.	That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like	and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.	So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.	I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't	this doesn't happen to a normal person.	You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.	But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.	I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.	Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop. M: Maybe-	Right. Thanks for talking to me.	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	3	3	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	4	0	0	1	0	3
I don't know, Brian, if they uh--it's been three years.	Hey, you just got to keep on going.	No, I don't know, I--maybe this isn't for me. You know, maybe this isn't the right business for me.	No, don't think like that.	I just, I see all these other people getting commercials and work and it's like I'm not getting anything.	I have no money behind me. Nothing. I'm twenty five and--	Russel Crowe wasn't forty until he got his big stuff. M: We're in-- M:	If you really want to do it-I mean,	So I'll have to wait twenty five years-	you got to do.	-just going and auditioning and auditioning and rejection after refection, it's like--	You could. You could. We just--	we're just pooling our funds together.	I know, I just don't know if I can handle it. I mean, you're helping me so much financially it's like I can't survive on my own without you. I don't like that.	You don't owe me anything.	I feel like I'm not doing anything. Like I'm not giving anything into this world.	You are, you're going to class, you're learning, you're getting better. When you finally get that role you're going to be prepared.	Yeah, but what if I never make it? What if I studied all my life, this theatre, this acting, and I'm never going to get anywhere. I'm never going to be able to have a job.	Oh my God, Anna, you're still young. Don't even think about that.	Time is passing by. Every year it's	a part left than I can do.	You're only twenty five, okay? Some people don't start until they're thirty five.	Yeah.	I don't know, I just [BREATHING] I get frustrated	What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.	That's the thing. I don't know. I don't know anything.	Law school? Maybe.	See? So you can't just quit now.	Have you been going to auditions and stuff?	Yeah. I mean, I get a call-back and stuff, but-	I just, I need a break. I need something to break me out.	How's the job? Still waiting tables at Denny's?	Well, they tip well.	[BREATHING] Brian-	it's not funny. I just don't know what I'm going to do.	Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.	Yeah, I guess I could.	Go back to school. You know? Another three more years, get your master's.	Yeah	Close to thirty. Oof, it's going to be tough.	[BREATHING]	1	0	1	0	3	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	3	0	3	0	3	0	1
Why did he invite her here?	Well, maybe he wanted see her.	It's been three and a half years. Why all of a sudden?	Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?	Don't look at me like that. He didn't tell me anything he told you.	How do you know he's even thinking about it?	Oh so what?	What is going on here, Joe?	Okay, now listen, kids...	The girl is not Larry's. If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.	Listen. Line. You can't read her mind.	And how do you know why she's waited.	Okay, look it's a beautiful day. Why are we arguing?	Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe. Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother.	What do you want me to do? What do you want?	I want you to---act like he is coming back. Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here. I won't stand for any nonsense.	Kate...	[BREATHING]	Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back? She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces. Look at it, Joe look.	All right, calm yourself.	Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.	Okay, calm yourself. Alright.	calm yourself.	You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.	What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?	Look at you. You're shaking.	What the hell do you want from me, Kate?	4	0	4	0	1	1	1	4	1	4	1	0	1	1	1	4	1	1	4	1	4	1	1	4	4	4	4
The only one I know still love his parents.	Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?	Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.	You're not sorry you came?	Not sorry, no. I can't stay here.	Why not?	For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.	[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...	What?	You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	You did?	From her point of view why else would I come?	Yeah--	Ann, I love you. I love you. F:[LAUGHTER]	I almost got married two years ago.	Why didn't you?	Everyday since.	why didn't you let me know?	Because I was waiting for you, Chris. Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.	I kissed you. I kissed Annie.	I'll never forgive you for waiting so long. All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.	I kissed you.	Chris, what's the matter?	Do you want to go somewhere? Let's go.	No, what is it? Is your mother?	No, no, it's nothing like that.	I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now. F: You got to...	You got to tell me.	I don't know. F: But what if...	It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.	Wouldn't work like this.	you know over seas I was in command of the company?	Yeah, sure.	Well I lost them.	How many?	Pretty much all.	[BREATHING]. Geez.	Takes awhile to toss something like that off. I mean they weren't just men, you know.	For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.	He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.	They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...	And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know. But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this. This monument...	You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.	I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...	You know. I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...	And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.	Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.	'Cause you can take those things out of a war. But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...	And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.	I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it. I guess I included you too.	Do you still feel that way?	I want you to know Annie.	I'm going to make a fortune for you.	What would I do with a fortune?	0	2	0	2	3	3	0	3	0	3	0	0	0	2	0	0	5	5	5	5	2	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2
