I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.	I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.	It's a beautiful thing.	What's this?	Which goes where?	I have no idea.	Done with the bookcase!	All finished!	This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.	Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.	You guys.	Oh, God.	You got screwed.	Oh my God!	5	0	2	0	0	4	2	2	3	4	3	3	5	5

Hey, Monica!	2
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.	Oooh!	W-wait. What is that?	'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?	No, no, I don't.	Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?	My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.	That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?	Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!	Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?	Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...	Why don't you just get a roommate?	Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.	0	2	4	2	4	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	3
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.	Okay, alright, I have a question, then.	Yuh.	Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?	Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.	Sure.	Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.	Rrrreally.	Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.	...Now? Now?	Oh yeah, right now.	Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.	Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?	I can hop.	6	0	0	0	2	0	4	0	2	4	6	0	2	2
Hello?	Hey!	Hi.	Hi! What-what're you doing here?	Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!	It'd be even more exciting if we were going.	Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?	Thank you, Max. Thank you.	So-so you're really not going?	I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.	Oh don't do that.	Please.	Oh no no.	No, but I'm asking-	Oh, but I can't do that-	No, but I can't-	It's your thing, and-	-make the decision-	Okay, um, stay.	Stay.	Stay.	Getting so good at that!

Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.	Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?	No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.	Ohhhh.	2	2	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	2	2
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.	So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.	Mockolate.	I'm sorry?	Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.	Ohh.	Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.	All right. Mmm-mmm.	Yeah?	I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.	No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.	Mmm-mmm.	But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.	Wow.	Aren't you going to swallow that?	Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.	Yeah, isn't that great?	Mmm.	Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.	Really?	Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.	2	0	0	4	0	4	6	5	0	5	6	5	6	0	0	5	6	5	2	6	2
How about Mockolate mousse?	It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.	Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?	What makes it pilgrim?	We'll put buckles on it.	Hey.	Hey.	Hey.	Did uh, Ross call?	No, I'm sorry.	No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.	0	5	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	3	6
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.	Hey, here's a thought, Ross.	Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.	Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.	Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.	Can't we just use a pen?	No, Amish boy.	Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.	I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.	You could say that.	Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?	I don't know.	Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.	Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?	She's not Rachel.	5	1	5	2	1	0	2	0	1	0	2	0	2	0	3

You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.	Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.	What?	What?	Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.	This was your idea?	What were you thinking?	Yeah. You!	All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?	Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.	6	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	4	0
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!	When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.	I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.	Not interested.	Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.	Number six: the way you smell.	Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?	Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?	Oh, yeah, I do.	What are you doing out there?	I am, uh, I am...	Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?	Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.	No.	No?	That's what I said.	Look, maybe we should go?	No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.	Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.	No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.	No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.	Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!	Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.	4	5	0	5	0	1	1	0	2	0	4	1	4	5	4	5	4	5	4	3	1	3	4
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.	Doesn't matter.	What?	Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.	Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.	Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?	Well, uh, I ate some.	Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot.

Hello?	Hi.	Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.	Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.	Look, can, can you do something for me?	Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?	The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.	Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.	0	0	1	0	4	6	6	2
Hi, thanks for coming in again.	Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.	It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called fishtachios.

Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.	Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.	Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?	Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.	What're you doing?	Just waiting for you sweetie.	Are you remaking the bed?	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.	Then, you're redoing it because...	If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.	You're pretty much running that risk either way.	Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.	Oh, well that's not so crazy.	I'm just easing you in.	Oh, alright.	Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.	Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.	Really?

But don't you need experience for a job like that?	It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.	Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.	Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.	No kidding.	Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.	Where do you work?	Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.	I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.	Fleischman's group.

Why aren't you at home in bed?	I'm sorry, I never had 'em.	Ohh, ohh.	Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.	Can I please see your face?	Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.	Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.	Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.	I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.

I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.	Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?	Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?	Weird world. Your kids?	I figure my character has kids.	Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.	Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.	Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.	Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.	Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.	0	1	1	0	2	0	2	0	0	4	2	1	2	2

Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.	Rough numbers?	This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.	Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.	Uh, if you say so sir.	Joseph's good, isn't he?	Well, I'm going to kill you.	Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.	Why?	Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it.

Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?	Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.	What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.	I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.	Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.	Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.	Karen.	Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her.

No freakshow, she's fictional.	Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.	Thank you.	It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him.

No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.	See that is the problem with invisible dentists.	Why? Why can't you go to him?	Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.	That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.	Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!	And all these people actually died?	Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!	Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.	Well tell that to them. Oh!

My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.	2	2	2	2	2	2	3	2	3	0	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	2	2	2	2

I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'	Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?	That's what you say at the end of a date.	You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'	Well, they always called.	Hmm, bite me.	0	0	2	0	2	2	3	2	2	2	4	0	1	1	5	0	5
Did he call?	No. Sorry.	Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?	Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.	Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?	Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.	Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?	Well...	The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?	No. I...	4	3	5	1	5	1	4	0	4	0

Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'	Well then you're going to have to take her out again.	Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!	That's fine!	That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.	I know.	2	4	4	5	4	5	6	5	5	4	5

I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.	They had to have that specially made?!	It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.	Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!	Oh, you go out with him.	Oh, really?!	Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
