Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?	Uh, what? Craig's List? Oh the internet thing?	Yeah.	I don't know. Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.	No. There's regular jobs on there.	I don't know. I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that-- I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.	Uh huh.	I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.	He's like a manager for a theatre.	He's like a house manager. Yeah. It's a good job.	He just...	you know what? I heard about that job. I applied for that.	You did?	Yeah. I saw a posting at the theatre.	Yeah. M: Hmm.	You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago. Right?	Yeah.	Hmm.	I don't know. He had a really good resume I guess and--	Yeah. Do you have a resume?	It's kind of helpful when getting a job.	I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.	Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.	Yeah.	No. You can- or you can just bring it in person. But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--	I'm there in front of them. I'm telling them what I'm good at.	Yeah. But the piece of paper helps, too.	Why? It's a piece of paper.	No. But it has an outline, you know.	I just don't want this paper trail, you know. I just don't want things following me around, like-.	I know. Okay. Well, um. Maybe--	It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before. You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but...	Yeah.	Okay, yeah. I would imagine.	Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.	That's baloney, that's baloney.	Please.	maybe get a car.	I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.	you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?	I didn't say that.	You know, you're riding the bus, too.	I am riding the bus, but by choice.	Why? What choice?	To save the environment, carpool.	You're saving the environment. mmhmm	Yes. One less car at a time.	Interesting. That's fantastic.	Mmhmm.	You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...	I'm not frustrated.	...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.	Who do you think you are?	I don't think I'm anyone.	You are so high and mighty. I just--	I- I-I didn't-- okay.	Oh. I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.	What? Oh. So now you're...	The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.	you know what? You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.	I can not-- you are not here by choice. Nobody would ride this bus by choice.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	4	1	4	0	4	0	4	1	4	1	4
Now and always sweet.	I don't care then.	I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.	That sent shivers up my spine.	No, wrong number.	Behave exquisitely.	That's serious enough.	I didn't hit you very hard.	5	5	5	5	5	5	3	0
Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Okay, what flight were you on?	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	On what airline?	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost. I was coming from Africa, so.	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Right.	Yeah.	Okay. Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row. I see it here. uh-	That's good.	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is. We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Well, I'm not a miracle worker. I don't know what I can do for you. I don't have the bag right here.	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here. But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Okay, and what is that? What kind of bag is it?	Um- It's a travel backpack. It's green and gray. It's got my name on it and my information.	And you couldn't find it?	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	Are you sure?	I mean we've gone through all of this. I've been to five people already who--	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	Okay.	All right? Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it. And was there something important in it that you need it?	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Sentimental value.	Right. Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Does this happen often? Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am. You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage. Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it? Where did it go? Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket. I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, we're talking about one bag. You personally made it here, didn't you?	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash. How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that. It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	Right. Yes, ma'am.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Well, I understand that. Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Why do I need flight insurance? Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Well, it's like any kind of insurance. You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time. Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag. Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Because they made me check it. It's too heavy.	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	There's nothing else you can do?	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do. My hands are really tied here. I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	I don't believe that for a second.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money. I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	What do you mean as you can? Who makes up these rules?	makes up?	You're an autono- autonomous human being. You could- You could go into the com-	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	And you have no guarantee.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	This is ridiculous.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Oh, come on. Would you cut it out? This is ridiculous.	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	No, I don't think I am. I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa. It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	Right.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost. There's nothing I can do about that. Things happen. Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	Thanks.	You have a wonderful day.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	4	0	1	1	0	0	4	4	0	4	1	1	4	1	4	1	4	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	4	0	1	0	4	0	4	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	0	4	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
The craziest thing just happened to me.	This girl; she just offered me fifty thousand dollars to marry her.	Why?	Well, she's not a citizen so she wants to get a visa.	Is she on the run?	No, no, no, no, no, no she just... she's not a citizen but she wants her visa, yeah. She's going to pay me fifty thousand dollars to marry her and stay married to her for two years.	Oh, she just needs to marry you.	That's incredible. That's awesome. Where's she from? Maybe you can get a dual citizenship.	That's like twenty five thousand dollar a year for doing nothing. Isn't that awesome?	She's actually from England, I think. Well she- she spoke English but she had an accent. I didn't even ask.	That's so cool. Uh huh.	[LAUGHTER] Why did she pick you? Where were you?	Fifty thousand dollars. Fifty thousand dollars. I was just out... I just... she's - well, she's a friend of friend but like...	You were at a party? And she's like hey. You seem unattached she's like.	Yeah. Can you believe that? Yeah, she's like hey, I'm like sure I'll do it, I don't care. Yeah. I'm like fifty thousand dollars, I'd totally do it for fifty thousand dollars. But the only thing is that's kind of like illegal. So like I could go to jail probably for a long if I get caught, but...	That's unbelievable... Yeah.	Well I've known people who have done this before. Yeah. You just- it's really fun actually 'cause you have like a fake engagement party and all your friends come over and like...	It's like I'm really going to get married. We'll have like the whole thing.	Oh, good. [LAUGHTER]	Yeah. Yeah. And then yeah, and then you know like you could like you could do like like sock her for a lot of money	I know. What do you think I should-	Like make her rent the apartment that you two have to live together in, you know. And you won't pay any rent or you pay like, a hundred bucks a month or something.	Oh good idea.	Yeah. Make her like open the bank account and stuff too.	Yeah.	It's a good idea.	Dude, you lucked out.	I know. Also I get to like plan the wedding now too. That will be fun.	Yeah. My colors are blush and beige what is it, do you know?	Something blue, something new, something... no I don't know. [LAUGHTER] So yeah, wonder if she's going to pay me up front but do you think it's bad though, do you think they're going to like track the money or something?	Oh I don't know. [LAUGHTER]	I don't know get it in cash.	Just cash hardcore.	Yeah.	What should we do? Where should we get married? We should have party.	How exciting. You should have a wedding on the beach.	Yeah, like a big like- A wedding on the beach, that would be nice.	Yeah, at night.	And then we can honeymoon. I want to go tropical though like Bahamas- --or like Tahiti or something. I just want to like beach and like drink.	Oh yeah, absolutely, absolutely.	How exciting. You should make her bring all your friends too.	I'll make her pay for that. I hear she's like totally wealthy. She's like royalty- --or something like and- --whatever like removed or something but yeah.	[GARBAGE] She's got to be loaded. fifty thousand dollars. That's incredible.	Incredible.	I'm going to marry a blue blood. [LAUGHTER]	you're a lucky, lucky, lucky man.	Will you help me plan?	Oh, totally. Yeah.	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	0	0	5	5	5	5	0	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5
That was the first time you ever hit me.	I didn't hit you very hard.	The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. Oh, dear.	How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	And very much sillier.	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	Not at all. It was very pretty. I still have it and I wear it often.	You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.	Line?	Let him kiss you.	You let him kiss you. You said you did.	What of it?	What of it?	What about me?	If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.	That's a nice point of view, I must say.	Oh, dear. I'm bored with this conversation.	So am I; bored stiff.	No, thanks.	I'll have a little myself, I think.	I don't see why you want it. You've already had two glasses.	No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.	It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.	You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.	It's become a habit with you.	You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	Oh, don't be so stupid.	Really, Amanda	What?	Nothing.	Going out somewhere, my dear?	No, just making myself fascinating for you	Oh. That reply has broken my heart.	As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	Oh, no, it isn't.	Yes, it is.	Oh, be quiet.	Line?	It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. M: It's a pity -- what?	It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	Line? F: Snap.	Snap. Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.	Adders don't snap, they sting.	They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	They sting.	They snap.	I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.	Yes, I did, quite a lot.	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?	Mind your own business.	You must have had a riotous time.	No restraint at all, very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.	You're quite insufferable. I expected it's because you're drunk.	I'm not in the least drunk.	You always had a weak head.	I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.	On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	Very interesting. And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?	Oh, shut up.	Not very funny, dear. You'd better have some more brandy.	Very good idea. I will	You better turn that off I think.	Why?	There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.	There are people downstairs, I suppose	Turn it on again, please.	Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	Turn it off. It's driving me mad.	Go away. Go away. I hate you.	Turn it off.	You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.	We swapped. Listen.	Listen--	Listen, indeed. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.	You're a vile tempered, loosed living	Stop.	wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.	Stop. I hate you. Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	This is the end. Do you understand, the end? Finally and forever.	You're not going like this.	Oh, yes, I am.	No, you're not.	Let go of me. You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you. Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.	Shut up. Shut up.	You're a mean, evil minded	Marry you again? Huh.	little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.	Never, never, never. I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.	Whore.	Swine.	4	0	2	2	2	1	1	5	1	4	2	0	0	4	4	4	4	1	4	1	4	4	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	4	4	4	4	1	1	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	1	0	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it. How you doing?	Fine.	Is that, is that - is that just foam? I can't even tell. Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them. It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	How you doing? Oh, no, you know what I did? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How could I be so stupid? I should have brought my flashlight.	It's not yours.	Whose is it?	It's ours. It's mine, too.	Well, sure.	You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours. How is that supposed to make me feel?	I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Remember?	Yes.	Are you cold? Do you want my jacket? We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.	You want my jacket?	It's after eleven; let's go home.	Are you kidding? We'd miss it. We just got here. What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?	There is no point in coming down here.	Right.	That's my point.	That's my point, too.	So let's go home.	No, no, no. That's not my point. My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?	Not particularly.	I just don't. It's stupid.	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, this only happens once a year. It's a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this. We're just forty minutes away. It's too good to pass up.	Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away. And then they die.	Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.	There's mystery here and magic. M: Uh, did I fuck up?	What are you so excited about? F: Big night.	Oh, it's a big night for these guys. Uh, life's last orgy.	This isn't a moon landing we're talking about. It's fish. It's fish nobody even eats.	Yeah, they do. Okay. But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that. F: Oh, Augie.	There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you can not be interested.	I'm just not.	Yes.	Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet. I got sand in my panties. We got into a big fight over nothing. You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.	We didn't see them the first time either.	no, it's just seaweed, isn't it? Oh, man, this is great. I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.	Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way. They don't know why. We don't know why. It wasn't a decision. They didn't take a vote. No one sent them an invitation or a map;	just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.	They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters. It's single mindedness with no mind. Urgency that's pure urge.	They don't know what drives them. They don't give it a name or ask a question. They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps. All my hairs are popping up.	That's the wind.	Well so what did you think?	About what?	5	0	5	5	4	0	4	1	4	5	4	0	0	4	1	4	0	1	0	4	1	1	4	5	4	1	5	0	5	1	5	5	1	4	4	1	5	5	5	5	5	1	5	1
Every day since.	I was waiting for you, Chris. 'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say? You sure can be ambiguous, you know.	I'll never forgive you. Why did you wait all these years? All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.	Yes, I suppose there has been. But it's going from me.	I don't know where to start.	It's all mixed up with so many other things. You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	Well I lost them.	How many?	Just about all.	Oh, gees.	It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.	For instance, one time it'd been raining several days. And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket. That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see? But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,	a kind of responsibility. Man for man. You understand me? And then I went home and it was incredible.	There was no meaning in it here. The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident. Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again. I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow	because nobody was changed. It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys. I felt wrong to be alive;	to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.	You have to be a little better because of that. Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it. I don't want to take any of it. I guess that included you.	Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.	What'll I do with a fortune?	2	2	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2
I don't want you to go.	I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.	I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard. M: It'll be alright.	I don't want to be a single mom.	You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and	but	and	It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll M: it'll- it'll	It's- It's dangerous anywhere, honey. I mean this is -this- I'm just going to go and we'll get it over with,	I hope so.	I hope so.	It's going to be really rough.	You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright? F: Without you	I'll send you lots of pictures.	I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.	I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.	Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.	I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get	It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.	there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country	and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back	Will you write me letters, paper ones?	Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.	Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.	I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.

Check this out. You know how I've told you I've been really into like softball recently?	Yeah.	Well, this is totally random, I got this full ride scholarship to go to U.S.C next year to play softball.	[LAUGHTER]. For softball? That's unbelievable. Is it slow pitch?	For softball. They're going to pay me to go to school. Isn't that awesome?	Yeah. Well, I don't--well yeah I can pitch, I'm not like the pitcher though. I'm like the pinch hitter guy I mostly just hit. But I guess I'm going to have to... Yeah, and then I play shortstop too but... It's so ex- The good news is I get to stay here.	Pinch hitting softball.	That is incredible.	That's amazing. They pay for everything?	I know. For softball, yeah.	Your housing, books, everything? That is incredible.	Yeah, everything. Every like- free ride and I get to, you know, like be on like a Trojans sports team too. And it's like cool. Isn't it awesome?	That is incredible. Do you get like a per diem?	I don't know. I should ask. Yeah, I will.	You should...You should look into that.	That is amazing, congratulations. Good for you.	Thank you.	But I don't know I want to live in the housing that they give me though 'cause I think I want to you know like get like a nicer place.	Oh.	Yeah, that you probably. You should see one of these Victorian houses around by.	Where should I move?	That's a really good idea. Or I could go to like Santa Monica. Go beach. Venice beach, yeah a little dirty though. I don't want to go to Venice beach. But - Malibu. All right.	Oh. Venice beach. F: Mmhmm.	Oh, you don't like that. You're west-sider?	Okay. That would be way too much of a commute you can't do that. Especially- I know especially from--I don't know, what I was going to say, I don't know.	Professional softball player Malibu. [LAUGHTER]	I don't know. Commuting from what Malibu that would be ridiculous.	Oh yeah, that would be. Well, depends on what type of car you had, though too. I guess it would be worth it. helicopter. Yeah, helicopter. There is a helipad there, right? Yeah, exactly.	Oh yeah. He'd drop you right off at practice?	They have those neon--softballs. They're like day-glow you can see them anywhere.	Oh. That is incredible. Is it--	do they have a--is it a co-ed softball team? I mean... Really? You know, I didn't even know that they have that.	They do it's--believe me it's huge.	Who do you play? Like do--are you like... nationally ranked?	I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and...	That is unbelievable.	It's pretty wild.	I would put that right up there with--ping-pong.	Yeah, well I doubt [GARBAGE] ping pong [GARBAGE]	I mean not to denigrate what you are doing. I think that's great.	No, no. I love softball. I played softball all the time.	I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.	For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time?	Yeah we have like away games and stuff.	But you know I'm like [GARBAGE].	You're like the rookie? The new kid.	Just watch in five years you'll be like on the force. You carry around donuts in your back pocket... [LAUGHTER]	I'm going to have a mustache...On the force...

Why did he invite her here?	She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-	Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.	Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?	Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	He's not going to marry her.	How do you know he's even thinking of it?	Well, so what?	What's going on here Joe?	-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.	You can't read her mind.	Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.	How do you know why she has waited?	She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for?	Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	What do you want me to do about it?	I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense	But Kate	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but	Calm yourself.	I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.	Calm yourself.	Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.	All right. All right. Calm yourself.	Just you above all need to believe.	Don't stop believing.	What does that mean, me above all?	Look at you -- look at you shaking.	I can't help it.	What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	4	4	0	4	1	1	4	0	0	4	4	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	3	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	1	1

I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time.	All right, sir.	I know, I'm sorry. It's-It's just that it's been a little frustrating because--	I completely understand. Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.	Okay.	Um, how may I help you. You're trying to book a specific flight?	Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-	Oh, yeah, absolutely. You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.	I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,	um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh, Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here.

I can take care of you all the way through to the end.	All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-	[BREATHING] that's good.	um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal. You're taken care of by the time that you get there. F: Uh huh. Yeah.	All right. I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.	Absolutely. we we	Yes, I completely understand. Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above. Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.	So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.	Okay. So--	Yeah.	Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a	Okay.	--you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um	Great. How many seats?	Well, it's gonna be four of them.

I guess	Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe? M: Okay. Okay.	Okay. Great. What time of the day would you like?	Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess. You know--	All right. Great. Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.	So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning. So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui. M: Okay.	And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.	Absolutely. That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel. You just give me your address. We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.	And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.	Yeah--I completely understand. It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.	All right. So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.	Absolutely.

Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.	[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that. He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.	He's not going to marry her.	How do you know he's even thinking about it?	It's got that about it.	What is going on here, Joe?	Now listen.	She is not his girl. She knows she's not.	You can't read her mind.	Then why is she still single? New York is full of men, why is she still single? Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.	How do you know why she waited?	Because she knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.	Hey look, it's a nice day, huh? Why are we arguing?	Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe. You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	What do you want me to do? What do you want?	I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you. Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.	I won't stand for any nonsense.	Kate.	Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back. She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces. Look at it, Joe, look.	[BREATHING]	Calm yourself.	Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry. Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.	Okay. Calm yourself.	I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay. Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?	I can't help it.	What have I got to hide?

You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	I know. It's going out of style isn't it?	No, it's good.	It's so lovely here. The air is sweet.	No. But I'm not going to stay.	What?	Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.	Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so. But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.	How did you know?	Well, from her point of view why else would I come?	I guess this is why I came.	Anne, I love you. I love you a great deal. I love you!	I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here. I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair? I want you to be ready for me Annie. I don't want to win you away from anything.	Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie! How long I've wanted to do this.	I'll never forgive you. Why did you wait so long? All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!	Oh Annie, we're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.	Not like that, you're not.	Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris. Chris, what's the matter?	Yeah, I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.	It wouldn't work like this.	It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	Remember when I was overseas? I was in command of the company.	yeah sure.	Yeah. I lost them.	how many?	just about all.	Oh gee.	Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-	for instance, there's this one time. It had been raining for several days. And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.	I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.	And I got an ideal, watching them all go down. Everything was being destroyed see and-	but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man. Do you understand me?	And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument. And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.	And then I went home and it was incredible. It had no meaning here.	It was all like some kind of bus accident to them. I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.	And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all. It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and	It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man. And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	Do you still feel like that?	I I want you now, Annie.	Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me? I mean everything that you have, you deserve. And that includes me. And your father? Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud. A man should be paid for that.	Oh Annie. Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!	What would I do with a fortune?	2	2	2	2	2	0	3	2	0	0	2	2	5	5	5	2	5	2	2	3	3	3	3	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	0	5	3	2	2
Oh, my God, look at that. Huh-oh, how many carats is that? F: [LAUGHTER]	Like eighteen? [LAUGHTER]	Oh, Jesus.	yeah [LAUGHTER]	Yeah, The Lousy Chaperone. [LAUGHTER] Uh huh.	[LAUGHTER] Uh- Drowsy.	at the end of the performance, you know, like we're all clapping and stuff. And all of a sudden I look over and	Joe's gone. -where did he go, you know?	And I'm like oh, he went to the- -the bathroom, but he didn't tell me, I didn't even notice him leaving. And all of a sudden, I swear to God, I'm sitting there and-	he comes up onstage-- And the entire cast everyone just like	goes up there and everyone's clapping and he's standing there and they put a spotlight on him.	Oh, my God.	And I'm like freaking out. I'm like what the hell's going on, you know. I don't know what's going on. And so he's like standing there and then all of a sudden they give him a microphone-	he asked me to marry him, like- onstage. I was like, I couldn't believe--and I had to walk up there and I was, like I think I tripped or something.	Yeah, I said yes, but I, yeah, I mean,	I don't know- it just like took me, took me by surprise.	He scored points.	Oh, yeah. Everyone--yeah. And people--friends of ours were in the audience, I didn't know about, like family members.	Yeah. It was great.	It was--I cried,	No, you deserve to cry. I mean, tears of happiness.	like a loser, I cried.	But, I don't know, I--it's so weird to think I'm marrying somebody 'cause I feel so young, you know?	No. No plans. or any- and probably	like I think I want to get married--I want to have two weddings. One here, then one in Europe.	That's awesome. [LAUGHTER] Marriage.	Yeah. I'm so excited. [LAUGHTER].	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	2	5	5	2	2	2	2	2	5	5
Hey sweetie.	Hey.	Um.	Uh, -Um	Why the sad face?	they need me out there sooner than I thought	They want to deploy me next week.	For--	They said anywhere from two to three years.	Honey--	--need me on the specialist honey.	You can't. We need you. I need you.	I don't want to go but,-	I don't care about the money.	but they said they'd increase my pay by triple-there promotion.	No.	Do this whole thing by myself?	Honey you're not going to be by yourself--	We'll have internet set up, we'll get web cameras and everything. My whole family's here too.	Carry her for nine months and then yes.	It's not the same thing. It's not like having you here.	I can't do this.	You can do it. Alright? You can, you can be strong, you can be strong for both of us alright?	I'm sick of being strong-- --for us.	I don't know what to do.	I don't want to - I don't- I don't want to go.	What am I supposed to do?	You can say no?	You know I can't say no.	You could. You really could. You could-- --get into another line of work. I could start working after Anna's born?	The last guy who said no was fired.	I put in fifteen years in this job.	I know.	I'm so close. Five more years and I retire-	and we'll have that happy life.	and watch our child grow, see her take her first steps, her first words.	Honey after a year I can be back.	You said two years.	They want me there two years but I could probably get	maybe get some vacation-- --once it quiets down there.	A whole year? --We're not talking about like a couple months here. I mean this is a whole year.	I know. I know. But they really need some good guys there.	What could happen in a year?	And this isn't the first time you know? I mean you always...sending you off to different places and...	Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.	I don't know if that's how I want to live my life.	It's just going to be--it's going to go faster than you think.	Joe I'm serious I don't want to have to have a little girl to tell...asking every day where's daddy, where's daddy and have to tell her that he's away--	far away and he won't be here.	You tell her-- [BREATHING]	I'm done. I can't honey.	What do you mean?	It's over.	Honey I can't do it anymore.	I need you here. Anna needs you.	So I have--you want me to choose between you guys or my career?	yeah.	What am I going to do?	Priorities honey, priorities.	I want to--what am I going to do if I leave this job?	You're smart. You could go back to school--	finish your Master's that you were started never finished.	Fine. I'll see if I can talk to them.	3	3	2	3	2	3	3	3	3	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	3	3	0	3	3	3	0	3	3	1	1	1	3	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	1	1	1	1	1
We'll be alright, darling. Whatever happens, aren't we?	I don't care, then.	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	Behave exquisitely.	With the mo- with the most perfect poise?	Certainly. I shall probably do a court curtsey.	But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	It's true. The whole business is a very poor joke.	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	You mustn't be serious, my dear. That's just what they want.	Who's they?	All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at everything. All their sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.	If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.	How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?	Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	No. That fire will fade along with our passion.	What happens if one of us dies? Does the one that's left, still laugh?	Well that's serious enough, isn't it?	Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Thank you, dear. The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.	Which particular one?	Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles. Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.	Horrible thing. I hated it.	I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	It went on intermittently for days.	It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.	Line?	How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?	That was the first time you ever hit me.	The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. Oh, dear.	How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	And very much sillier.	As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	0	5	4	0	5	5	3	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	5	5	0
Well, so, what do you think?	About what?	What I was just saying.	It's ridiculous.	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	I'm sorry. It's just, it's it's just fish to me.	uh, Carla Can I ask you a question? no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	God damn it, Augie. Seriously, you always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's so insulting.	What's bugging you then?	I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.	It's not that complicated. We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing. We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish. And then they go home and we go home.	We We don't ever. Have we ever?	We've missed them twice. That's hardly ever.	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever	No, we won't. It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something. I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up. And the fish will not show up.	Okey, They're just fish. It's nothing to get traumatized over.	You don't understand anything I am saying.	No, of course not.	I did want to see it. I always want to see it. I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	I'm trying to work this backwards. But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here. Okay, so --	you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem. All right. So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go. I'm feeling lucky. And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.	Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion? It was about four years ago right after we got married. We thought I was pregnant. We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses. You asked me to dance. We took off our shoes. And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking to myself, finally. I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	It was in the car, right? When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right? You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	I would rather not remember some things. I'd rather not hope for something.	No.	No.	No.	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	Do you want to get married again?- What? What, do you want a divorce?	A vacation?	No.	A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack? What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	Well, welcome to the human race. Do you think this is what I had planned? Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?	Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska? No. No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come. And the bills would magically pay themselves. And we'd have three fat rosy kids. But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Because you know what you get, Carla? You know what you get? This.	Right.	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	Now, I know. Me either	This is just this. I mean, it's a lot and everything. But it's not, you know, something else. Am I making any sense?	I'm trying the best I can.	I know that, Augie. I do. I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?	I didn't say that.	No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.	For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	Yes. Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	Actually, now that you mention it, no. I don't.	I don't know. I think this is a pretty good spot. I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	Yes, I did notice that. It does look really beautiful over the water. Big old white moon.	Oh, well look what we've got here.	Well, it isn't champagne.	No. I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think this might be the spot after all. Augie, I'm sorry.	Or not.	Or not.	5	0	5	0	1	1	0	4	1	1	1	1	1	4	4	1	1	1	3	1	1	3	3	3	0	3	3	3	3	1	1	1	3	1	3	4	4	4	1	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2
I'm just so tired all the time.	Well have you been trying to get a job, look for a job or...?	I've been looking for like eight months.	I know. It- It's really tough out there. It's really hard to find a job.	I'm tired of the same excuses. No, no you're not qualified enough, wish you had more education.	Well what are you looking for? I mean--	Well, okay. Well that's--	Cause I went to Harvard.	I applied as restaurant manager at P.F. Chang. I applied at----Macy's store manager. Tried to get investment banking job with Deloitte and Touche. I'm trying everywhere.	You know what? I've been working at temp jobs for the past six months. You know how degrading it is?	Yeah.	Yeah.	I'm smarter than half the people I work for.	I don't know astronaut? I don't know something crazy like that.	Well what'd you major in?	Biomedical Engineering.	I don't want to do engineering though. It's so...I had the internship what, last summer,	and I was pulling my hair out and it was like, oh my God. So I just had to finish the major so now they're like, why are you an engineering major, and why are you working, trying to work at a restaurant. And it's like I don't know just give me the damn job.	Why all these questions?	Oh yeah? What kind of jobs they got?	I am...just like a law clerk.	Well, I'm moving up. I mean it could be...	To be a lawyer? You go to law school now? God this is, all these dead ends.	And plus my car is breaking down-	-they're evicting me from my apartment.	No. I'm not going to...yeah, they'd laugh in my face.

Well obviously it's not working. Just cause you got sixteen hundred on your S.A.T. doesn't guarantee you a job. I mean it should really but--	I don't know. I don't know. I know I'm just going to have to keep on looking, keep on searching-	and I'm never going to find anything probably but I'll just keep working hard at it-- Yeah. Okay.

Hello. Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate. Can I help you?	Yeah, um. I have been trying to reach somebody who will refund, uh, my money.	Um, I basically, um I- I ordered some food	um and everything was pretty much uh- uh- just not done right. All the orders were messed up.	Okay. Well, Did you go through the automated menu? Most of your requests can be taken care of through that.	Yes, I did and that didn't- I got through to, like, one operator and she sent me to like three others	Okay. Well I'd be happy to-	If you could just give me that, then I will leave you alone. And just- if i could also- What?	Okay, sir. I'd be happy to help you. F: Can you-	Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to. We can start there.	Okay. Um, and what was the complaint?	The food was prepared incorrectly.	I asked for no tomatoes.	Can you be a little more specific, sir?	Did you try to take them back and get your order fixed, sir?	Well I'm very sorry, sir. They should have dealt with it at that particular branch. I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you. That's no worries. We can take care of that. So how much did you need to be refunded?	It was a hundred a sixty dollars. I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.	Okay. Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department. They'll need your address.	Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check.	Okay. You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this. Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now F: I understand that, sir-	and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again. I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind. So if you could please just not do that, that would be great. Thank you. F: I-	I understand, sir. I will explain to them what the situa-	You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten. You don't understand.	You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.	You're going to fill out a form on your desk	because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.	Okay, sir. They- they have to-	Sir.	Sir, they have to take down your address at the other station. I will transfer. I will explain everything to them. It will all be fine. I promise.	What's your name?	Cindy?	Cindy? Cindy what?	Sir, I don't think my name is really relevant-	Cindy, look. If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check	attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.	Alright, sir. Sir. I'm going to transfer you to the address.

What?	I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.	I guess this is why I came.	Ann, I love you. I love you a great deal. I love you.	I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.	I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell it to you here. I	Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.	And he's gone forever. You're sure?	You started to write me.	Every day since.	I was waiting for you, Chris. Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say. I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.	Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a-God I kissed you.	I kissed Annie. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.	I'll never forgive you. Why did you wait all these years? All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.	Annie, we're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.	No, nothing like that.	Yes. I suppose I have been but it's going from me.	I don't know where to start.	There's so many things mixed up.	You remember overseas I was in command of a company?	Yeah, sure.	Well I lost them.	How many?	Just about all.	It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.	For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.	I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.	They didn't die. They killed themselves for each other. I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	And I got this idea watching them go down. Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made	a sort of responsibility man for man. You understand me?	And then I came home and it was amazing.	I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow	because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.	I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.	when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man. You've got to be a little better because of that.	Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it. I didn't want to take any of it.	I guess that included you.	Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.	What'll I do with a fortune?	4	0	2	2	2	2	2	0	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	3	3	1	3	3	0	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2
It's only going to be a year.	There's nothing I --	You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?	It's -- look, it's only a year. It'll go by quickly. Okay.	I know, but I'll be back then. And - and- and we'll have -- we have the rest of our lives.	I can't do that. I have to go.	Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind? I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this.	I've made a pledge. I can't not do this at this point.	I know that. I know that. I know that.	There's nothing I can do. I mean, I have to go.	And this is what I do. This is -- I mean, this is my life. And I know that you're part of my life, too, and I mean, it's only -- it's just going to be a year. I'll be back.	Can't you ask them? Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change assignments or something and you could stay here?	It's not- it's not- It's not like that. It's not like that. I can't do that.	Why not? You could, at least, try. They have to understand	Because it's impossible. There's -- I just can't. I can't.	You won't even know your child when you come back. This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?	Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here.	Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year.	It's only going to be a year. I'm not going to miss my son's entire life.	And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer? Are you just going to agree? Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do?	I'm not going to stay more than a year. I've agreed to a year	Then why do you have to go a year at all?	Because I've already agreed to that.	Well unagree. Tell them that you can't leave right now. I can't do this by myself. I can't do this without you.	Yes, you can. Yes, you can. You know you can. You're a strong person.	It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day.	What else can we do? I -- we don't have a choice in this. Do you understand? You can't come with me and I can't stay here. That's all there is to it.	There has to be something. I mean, we can't just live with this. It's not -- it just won't work this way.	We don't have a choice. I have to do this.	Just tell them no.	I can't do it. I'd love to. I mean, I don't - if you understand, I don't want to stay.	I mean, I don't want to -- I don't want to leave. I want to stay here with you.	Then, can't you please try something? If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask.	Can't you just make an effort? Can't you just try?	I've asked already. I can't go back.	It can't happen. I have to go. I want to stay really bad, but I can't. There's just no -- I don't have an option.	When do you leave?	Next week.	A week. You're giving me a week to be okay with this.	You can't make it out like I'm happy about this. I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation.	Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.	I am. I mean, I don't know. I don't know what else to tell -- you know, I mean, I can tell you. I don't know what else to do. I mean, I've been forced into this situation.	If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out.	There's nothing I can do. I-- I	They won't let you come along. It's not going to happen.	It's a free world. I can go where I want. Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go.	Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.	[BREATHING]	I'm finding a way to make it work. And I will go wherever you go. Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.	Look, I--	You're not really giving me a lot of options.	Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth. Okay.	But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.	But I've been trained. You have no training.	You have to. Do you understand me? You have to.

What time is it? Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight? This is great, isn't it? Look at this great night we got here. Couldn't be better--	actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it. How are you doing?	Fine.	Is that--no, no no is that foam? I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it? Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think? How you doing?	Oh no, you know what I did. I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid? I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.	What flashlight?	The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?	It's not your flashlight.	Whose is it?	Well, Sure.	I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours. How's that suppose to make me feel?	No, Of course, you are right. Our flashlight. Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally. How can we not think to bring it?	yes.	Are you cold? You want my jacket? We should have bought a blanket. Our blanket-. This is great, isn't it?	I didn't even think to bring a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot. And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.	[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around	you want my jacket?	It's after eleven, let's go home.	There is no point in coming out here.	Right.	So let's go.	Not particularly.	Why not?	I just don't.	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, It happens like once a year. It's a great opportunity.	Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away. Too good to pass up.	Pass up what? Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.	This is a big night for these guys. Life's last orgy. Yeah	What are you so excited about? I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish. Its fish nobody even eats.	Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.	There's There's mystery here and magic. A little bit of the unexplainable. I can't understand how you could not be interested.	I am just not.	Yes.	Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight. You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.	We weren't in a good spot.	We didn't see them the first time either.	Look there, what's that? Is it? Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?	Oh, this is great. I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.	Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction. They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation. And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision. And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.	It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.	They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters. It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them. They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.	Well, So what do you think?	5	5	0	5	5	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	5	5	5	5	0	1	5	1	0	1	0	5	5	1	5	5	1	5	5	0	0	1	1	1	5	5	5	5	5	5

What are we going to do?	Now and always sweet.	Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.	Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.	Behave exquisitely.	With the most perfect poise.	Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.	Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?	Oh darling don't say that.	Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?	What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth? Good God what does it all mean?	You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.	Who's they?	flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.	Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.	No, that desire will fade along with our passion.	Oh dear, should we like that?	Yes, yes, with all his might.	No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.	So is everyone else in the long run.	Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.	Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	Which particular one?	Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.	I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	It went on intermittently for days.	It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.	That was a rouser, wasn't it?	The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	I'll never forget his face.	Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.

They didn't...	I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.	There's people that have given more though, you know?	I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.	I know.	There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.	I don't know how you can be okay with this? I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.	Just, you know, kicking myself.	things just aren't what they seem.	I know.	I just don't see why it has to be you.	If not me then, who?	What am I going to do? Huh?	You'll videotape everything, yeah?	Yeah.	Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?	Don't you guys have access to computers over there.	Last month-- Yeah.	I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.	I have to find sitters.	I can't raise a baby by myself. How?	We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh? Because there is a day care down the street.	I know.	And your mother is close by.	I'll send you lots of letters.	And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.	It's just not fair.	3	3	3	3	0	3	1	3	0	3	3	3	1	3	3	3	3	3	3	0	3	3	0	3	3	0	0	3	3	1
Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,	it's just like nobody- nobody wants to hire me. It's been years, I mean, do you understand, years? Like, I'm -- you know what I mean, it's like I've been collecting unemployment for so long now, it's just like I just -- I can't take it. I don't know what to do. I mean, I'm just like losing my mind.	Well there has to be something you haven't tried.	I-I'm not kidding. I've tried everything. Like I've gone to every business and local, you know,	local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything. Like, nobody -	What about like a temp agency?	Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency? Maybe they can help.	there's just like no jobs available. I mean, it's just like, God.	Yeah, I tried that. And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once. But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long. And it's not enough to live on.	Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them. You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and	I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.	Yeah, I do. I do. You don't understand.	I- You don't understand. I don't have a job. All- My job is to look for a job. I don't do anything else.	But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits. It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane.	Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know. Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while. Find a new field, new skill.	No, no, no, no, no. I can't- I can't do that. I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?	Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.	I'm not choosing. I'm not-	If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.	No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them	-- I mean, I don't understand. It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough. I just don't understand. Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years.	Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.	This is stupid.	I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--	You know what, this is your fault.	It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead. And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--	It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?	Yeah, exactly.	Well that sounds like your fault.	Yeah.	You didn't do what I told you to do.	That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing. And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because	-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why.	Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?	I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.	That's not true. I take responsibility for my own actions.	Really? Whose fault is it you don't have a job?	Yours. I don't--	[LAUGHTER]	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.	God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.	How you doing?	Fine.	Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.	Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?	How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?	What flashlight?	You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?	That's not your flashlight.	Who's is it?	It's ours; it's mine too.	But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?	Yea.	You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?	Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,	oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.	You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?	I'm cold.	It's after eleven. Let's just go home.	Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?	There is no point in coming down here.	That's my point.	So let's go.	Not particularly.	I don't, it's just stupid.	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.	Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.	Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.	Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.	This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.	What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.	Yes they do.	Augie	Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs	you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.	I'm just not.	Yes.	And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.	Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.	We didn't see them the first time either.	We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.	There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?	This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.	Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,	they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.	Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.	It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,	they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.	Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.	That's the wind.	About what?	It's ridiculous.	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	5	5	5	5	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	5	5	1	5	5	1	1	1	5	5	3	0	1	4	1	1	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	0	1
So, how's it going?	Oh, you got what? Where?	I got into U.S.C.	Oh, no way.	Yeah, I'm so excited. So I'm gonna say--	Are you gonna go? you gonna-	Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go? Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway.	So--	Wow, that's...	...that's first choice, huh? That's so awesome and now look you're gonna be--you're gonna be here. you know	Yeah, I know.	Absolutely. I'm so excited.	I know. I know. And we'll all get to hang out. And I'm--even though we'll be at like at different parts of the city, we can still, like...	...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff. So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school	Yeah, no, definitely--It's gonna..	Yeah.	and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like... M: Wow.	Yeah	Fight on.	You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C.	And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you...	[LAUGHTER]	Wow. That's cool.	...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished. Do you know what I mean?	Like it has some prestige. so	Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff. But, it'll be fine--	Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind.	I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork. You know--	So...	Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore. I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know	Right. Right. Right. Oh, man, then you're going to have to do orientation, I guess.	I know. I know. I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything. Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited. M: Oh boy. Right. Yeah. It'll be crazy.	That'll be awesome.	I mean because you went to the campus before, right?	Yeah, oh totally. It's a beautiful campus. It's gonna be really nice. Um, and everyone is friendly and like there's ivy on all the walls. Oh, it's just so--it's so like collegiate.	You know what I mean? Like, it's like exactly what I want.	Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first...	...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one. So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this. You know what I mean?	So, um, so I don't know.	I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see.	Oh man.	I- They have like--they just have so many like prestigious like this school is top ten and like the departments within it, you know what I mean.	I know, I get to be one of those now--I'll like walk around and be like a U.S.C.. You know what I mean.	Ahh. Yeah. [GARBAGE]	You'll be like are you a fan or a student you know? Student. [LAUGHTER] Oh man, that's awesome.	And you'll be like...	Student. I'm a student. Yes I am, Thank you very much.	[BREATHING]	A U.S.C. graduate now. You're set.	I know. I'm excited.	Well, that'll take a while. [GARBAGE]	That's going to be a lot of work.	But, it'll be fine, I mean. I'm so excited. It's going to be so fun.	I know, and I mean the area's not great, but like the school makes up for it. It'll be fine. It'll be good.	You're getting close to the beach. I mean geez.	I know. I know. So fun. I can't wait.	I will. I will. Thank you.	Thanks.	0	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	0	5	5	5	2	2	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5
Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage.	Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel--	No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that?	Okay. Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the--	Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-	You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen.	Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents--	How much?	Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for--	Right. Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do.	That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?	I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--	Yes, yes, I would like to file a claim, but what are you gonna--I mean, is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere?	Right. No. I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now--	Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating. Unfortunately though-- um	Because you don't seem to care very much, you know.	By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk--	I didn't sign anything.	Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--	You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us. So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do. So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?	[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation. I'm supposed to be here for three weeks. What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks?	Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--	But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything.	No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you	Isn't there anything else you can do?	probably even talk to--	I mean, is there somebody you can call? Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane. I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage. I mean, did it get stolen?	Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of. We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh F: He needs to look into that--	Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage? No. Oh, okay, thanks. Great. I mean how--	but Unfortunately sometimes is--	Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--	There needs to be better security here.	Okay. Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want. And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.	It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever. It's a big deal to me.	All right, Miss, I-I know. I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.	Well, can I at least have my fifty dollars, please?	Yes, all right. There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out.	Thank you very much.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	1	0	0	4	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	4	0	1	0	1
